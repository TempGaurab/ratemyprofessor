He does try to trick you on exams, he will tell you he likes to challenge you on the exams.   It also takes him a long time to get things graded.  This is okay when you have large classes, but our class was very small and we were taking our first big exam before we knew what we got on our quizzes so you didn\\'t know where you were for weeks at a time.  I really enjoyed him as a professor overall but you will find yourself frustrated at times because he adds concepts to quizzes and tests that he didn\\'t cover in class all that thoroughly or that the homework didn\\'t cover.  This only bothered me because he claims he follows homework when he makes his exams out but he adds concepts that the homework didn\\'t cover, at all. Or he adds items to exams that he BARELY goes over in class.  If you are someone who needs practice and lots of examples in homework to practice & study, him adding concepts to tests that he barely went over, you will struggle.  My advice is to work problems from each section, even the ones he says you don\\'t need,  because he will add stuff.  For example, when we covered even and odd functions, telling if a function is even or odd, etc, the homework doesn\\'t cover those things but he added it to our 2nd exam.  So when you go over a study guide for the exam, he will add things and your like, \"Ummmm our homework didn\\'t cover this,\" so then you basically have to learn new concepts at all once.  Also, when we covered trig functions, he added coterminals to the quiz and that was no where in the section we were being quizzed on so you basically have no real way of studying for his quizzes or exams when he does tricks like this.  I\\'m doing very well in the course, but him consistently doing this, it got so tiring and frustrating toward finals time.  I feel exhausted because you never know what to expect from his tests.  I think he assumes we are all math experts and know all of this math so studying can be so exhausting when he throws things in without warning us or preparing us adequately.  I never even heard the term coterminal in his class and yet we were quizzed on it, so be warned.',\n",
