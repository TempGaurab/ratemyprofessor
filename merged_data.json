{"Name":"Michael Simonton ","Comment":["Professor Simonton's ANT 201 is the easiest class you will ever take. Class attendance is not required. The class discussions and ePaper are graded on completion. The Exam questions and answers are posted word for word on study guides, and these exams are taken online. Do not pass up the opportunity for an 100 in your GPA.","Easiest class I have taken so far. This was online and I probably spent 10 mins per discussion and an hour max preparing and taking each exam. The study guides are identical to the exam so if you study them you should get a 100% without an issue. Simonton clearly cares about what he teaches and is passionate about students. ","TAKE TAKE TAKE. Easy GEN-ED, Simonton is a very great professor. His tests and quizzes are very easy and he has study guides that help a lot. You would be hurting yourself if you didn't take his class. ","He is very passionate about his subjects, but every class is just lecturing, which can get pretty boring. Most people don't show up to class, tests and coursework are very easy, and he is funny. ","I LOVE HIM! I had him first semester and I have him again this semester. He's very passionate about the content of lectures and very engaging. He is absolutely hilarious and always finds a way to relate to our humor. His class is an easy A as long as you use the notes he puts on canvas :)","One of the best professors at NKU.","Honestly, even the \"show up and pass\" is an overestimation of how easy his class is. He gives the students the option to learn the course material or not. He gives you all the tools and information to learn, but he also will give you an A if you don't even do more than an hour of work for the class.","This professor is great! First, he gives extra credits if number of people in the class is less then 15 people. ( I got 100 extra credit points thanks to this, it's equal to \"writing assignment\"). Before every exam he give study guide or condensed notes which is copy paste of actual exam. You just have to remember what on those notes. He is great!","Took this class online, was the easiest class on my schedule all semester. At your own pace all you have to do is take 3 quizzes which are all on Quizlet. And there is one research are which was cake I got a 100. easiest gen ed I've taken. high recommend if you want an easy A and credit.","I took this class cause I needed another class to add to be full time. Professor Simonton responds quickly to emails and this class was graded by 3 exams and 1 paper. All exam questions are on quizlet. It says you need the book to read every week but I didnt read anything out of the book and still ended up with an A.","He is a great professor and the class was very interesting!","Dr. Simonton is an amazing professor! His lectures are so interesting, and you only really need the book for personal study. Just show up and take notes and you'll pass. His review days before the exam are great too! You'd be fine if you only attended those, though attendance is an extra-credit opportunity.","I had this class online. The review material really helps when taking an exam. Also, had interesting topics for the one paper we had to do. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!","If you show up to class and there are less than 15% of students, you get extra credit. I ended with a 105% . He is a sweet older guy and very nice and caring. The class period before an exam he give the answers to the test, reads questions off the test mostly in order.","It was a super easy class, though his grading method is weird. I am yet to receive my final grade, but I got a 100% on two\/three assignments and a 98% on the other because it was so easy. Just do the work and dont stress too much like I did! He also responds to questions super fast. A textbook was a requirement but I did not buy it.","I LOVE HIM! He is HILARIOUS! Class is so easy; he gives more extra credit than any professor I've had; he goes over and all but gives you the answers to the test. The content is actually interesting (sometimes - cash crops were NOT) and his explantions are well thought out and funny. I thoroughly enjoyed this class and reccommend it.","He was a great easy teacher.","Dr. Simonton is amazing!! He's so down-to-earth and he's super funny. Lectures are pretty interesting and he knows a lot of random interesting information that he slips into his lectures. Super kind, 100000% recommend taking his classes!!","He was amazing and I learned a lot from him. There aren't many assignments so you need to be on top of things otherwise you can fail easily.","His lectures are pretty boring and used the ENTIRE 30 minutes. As long as you show up on the review days you will pass the class.

If you show up, do the work, and try your best, you'll do well. I am not an actress and have since left the theater department, but I still learned a lot about myself as a writer and director in his class. He genuinely cares about his students and I would highly recommend him.","I have since changed my major, but I had Charlie for a lot of classes my freshmen and sophomore year. He was always very caring, hilarious, and made me want to be not only a better actor, but a better person. Sometimes I think I majored in MT just to have him as a professor because he was that great.","Show up and put real thought into your participation and you'll be fine. Professor Roetting was one of my favorite instructors as a freshman and every now and then I'll see him at the place where I work- he still remembers me! I learned so many valuable things that will take me far as an actress; his lectures are in-depth, inspirational, and funny.","Being a theatre major but not at all an actor, Charlie took that into account and still made the class easy. Probably one of the easiest, most fun classes you could take, and he's hilarious! He has a million stories to tell, and he's a really great person. The only assignments were seeing 3 NKU shows, a midterm monologue, and a final scene.","Very easy course, and Charlie tries to make every student feel comfortable in class. The only purchases required were mandatory tickets to see plays. Only a handful of assignments all semester, but most were based on participation.","this is a great man","Charlie is a great guy. He was very forgiving for my attendance and homework assignments due to a special circumstance. Not only that, but is class was always fun and engaging. Even though I am a CIT major, I enjoyed his class a lot and it did reignite a spark for acting I forgot about. PLEASE take this instead of public speaking, way better 100%.","Charlie was amazing! I enjoyed going to his classes, he is easy to talk to, understanding, funny, and overall a really good professor.

Just pay attention, be respectful, and be yourself and you will be good to go.","Great teacher","Charlie is one awesome dude. He gives great advice and tells great, super funny stories. Amazing professor for theatre and non-theatre majors.","I loved his teaching so much I made him my adviser!","He's a smart, funny, interesting professor, that has some amazing stories. If you have any problems with his class, college, or life in general he has some of the best advise you could get. He's really chill but make sure not to talk while he's taking. It's his pet peeve and also it's rude. Besides you defiantly wanna hear what he has to say.","This class requires to things to absolutely ace it: attendance and participation. You don't need to be enthusiastic, just show up and when he calls you follow along. It's mostly fun games with a couple assignments, a pretty easy class and very fun.","Great guy! Fun class, will challenge you appropriately to your level, great feedback, I could go on and on. I took this as a 9 AM and it was completely worth waking up early for.  Recommend for both Theatre and non-Theatre majors.","There's this new thing he did this semester, where you have to see or read 15 plays and write like a paragraph about it, it sounds hard but it's super easy.

Easy grader on speeches, but the lectures leading up to speeches were brutal. Lectures were really stories he usually repeated, but they were very entertaining. Required to print a copy for him on speech day, but you could read straight from it if you wanted. 1 intro, 2 info, 2 pers. 1 impromptu. ","Very nice and easy grading. But beware, most of the lectures are political rants and personal stories that he will tell several more times throughout the semester. He gives his side of politics and his side only. Very outspoken about his hatred against certain Presidents and holds religion in contempt.","He likes to listen to himself talk about himself. His photography is not that good, but he does not know this. His book is self-published, so there you go!","He is an interesting teacher with lots of stories (many boring) to tell during his mandatory classes. He mostly just talks about himself during class. The coursework is fairly easy, just do the ebook modules and don't mess up the guidelines of the speech. (saying uh or um) He is a pretty tough grader when it comes to speeches. ","My favorite professor this semester. Skaggs is an easy grader, there is 4 speeches that you have to do and one easy paper. The rest of the class is him telling hilarious stories about his life and easy online modules.","Skaggs is probably one of the best professors I've had. He makes class fun and enjoyable and always has a story. He loves teaching and loves his students. He lets you know what's on the test and they're all open note and open book. Every paper you turn in is an easy 100% as long as you meet the page requirement which is usually 1-2 pages.","Very lecture heavy, but he adds a lot if personal stories to make them enjoyable. Easy A if you do all the work and meet the criteria for the speeches.","Tells a lot of great stories, easy grader.","Skaggs typically tells alot of his own personal life stories and he tends to be very understanding and easy going when it come to people giving speeches. He gives maybe 2 exams at best but the main grade is from speeches. study the chapters for the final exam and mid-term and you should be fine","loved Skaggs! great professor and a pretty easy class.","Professor Skaggs was a generally easy professor, he was very understanding and willing to work with me on extensions. There are a lot of papers but generally as long as you do them right and turn them in you get credit.

He is very knowledgeable, cares about his students, and loves to tell stories. He lets you pick all of your speech topics and gives great feedback. I highly recommend taking his courses. He was my favorite professor in my first freshman semester.","He was amazing! I had different things going on in my life and he was super understanding. The speeches were not difficult, take his class!","I had to take his public speaking class online due to covid, which made this class easier for me. I love him and he had the best stories. He never tried to sell any of his photography to us as other comments say. He was really caring. The bookwork is tedious though but other than that, just follow the requirements for your speech and its an easy A","Professor Skaggs creates a very fun and comfortable environment, which makes giving speeches less daunting.

He doesn't explain criteria\/subject matter clearly, constantly wastes our time by having the same tech issues every week, & makes uncomfortable remarks. He pushes his (mediocre) photography work on us and the extra credit options are to go support his exhibitions.

Jo is so caring and helpful. She is always willing to work with you outside of class hours and is great at explaining things in different ways. She is funny and sweet. She is an amazing teacher. She really knows and loves this subject.","Abosolutely so compasstionate. I had a panic attack during the final and she helped me through it and the problems I couldn't figure out. I Dealt with a lot of depression and she was so patient and helped make sure I still passed while not dumping a bunch of late assignments on me. Totally wonderful!","She helped me gain confidence in my math skills and prepared me for my pre-calculus course, which I passed with an -A. A real gem of a professor, she took the time outside of class to help explain concepts to me that I didn't immediately understand during the class. If you don't understand something then ask, she will explain it until you get it!","Joetta is the best teacher I have ever had.

She's even letting me take her class even though it's full! She's the best math teacher you can get!","Joetta is great! I would not have been able to learn material as well as I did without her help. She's very outgoing\/friendly and was always willing to help me with anything I needed. We used ALEKS to complete homework and I LOVED it. One of the best learning programs I've ever used.","She is very sweet, and cares about her students. She wants to make sure you pass.","I have never been good at any form of math, but thanks to this professor I received the first A of my life. She rewards hard work, as she exempted me from the final exam for maintaining an A all semester. She is always willing to help students, and she is understanding if you can't always attend class because life happens.","Best teacher!!! So laid back and will answer any questions you have!!! Literally! She won't get mad she's always happy! You can't fail her class. Almost impossible to get a c if you come to class!

(if that's possible for math to have fun) She is the best math teacher i have personally ever had!  She's nice and offers all kinds of help if you ask!  She also works as a high school teacher so i think that may be why she is so good at Explaining!  Great Teacher!

His tests are easy, and you watch alot of films. The book was free through the library but the papers you wrote every week were weighted pretty low, so your grade would never go up. Also, assignments had no due date on Canvas, which made things a little hard to follow. Pay attention and work hard, and you'll get an A.","Everything about this class is easy! Tests are easy, Lectures are easy to follow, and you only have one research paper to type that is about 1500 words. Eric is a very respectful teacher although he expects students to show up on time to class and be present. He will give extra credit opportunities very frequently!","This class was one of Dr. Bates' first online classes he taught, but he did a very good job. LOTS of reading, and then essay writing on the books that you read, with a final paper over all of the books that you read. But he is very honest, gives great feedback, and will work with you to help get your paper to be the best it can be.","HE IS AMAZING PERIOD!","This class was a gen. ed. for me. It was okay, but the material got pretty boring since it was online. Nothing too special.","This guy is an absolute legend. Super easy class to take and honestly very interesting. 100% would take it again and definitely would recommend it to a friend. Bates is super laid back and all-around an awesome guy.","Fun and engaging class. Helps explain missed question and always gives good feed back on your reading responses.","I'm a politically conservative student, but I enjoyed being challenged by this class. If you're worried about political bias and need to take a gen-ed class this is the one to take because Mr. Bates will not try to crush you or force you to think his way and dock your grade if you don't.","Eric is a professor I would recommend to anyone whether you're an anthropology major or not. There is a midterm and final that are pretty easy if you go to class and pay attention at all. Lectures are very interesting and insightful! Very respectful and a chill guy.","Not your average professor, very friendly and inviting atmosphere. Have multiple of his classes and have enjoyed them. Would highly recommend for any one of all majors, this is the prof you want to learn anthropology from and Native Indian studies (231) is a course everyone should take!","Lectures are very interesting. He is very knowledgeable and passionate about the subjects he teaches on so it makes you want to learn more. Tests aren't hard at all if you pay attention in lecture and study. Final paper wasn't anything to stress over. Easy class with a laid back professor.","Excellent class. An easy A because of the high quality of the instruction, not because the professor doesn't care. Grades tests on a curve, very reasonable, and plenty of opportunities to make up work.","I loved this class so much! It was my favorite one this semester. Eric didn't make the lectures boring which made it easier to learn.

He doesn't take attendance, but all of his notes are only on the board during class lectures. So go to class!","One of the best what NKU can offer! The lectures are always useful discussions after watching a short documentary and you only have to write a short reading response once a week.

It is definitely an easy A, but you have to go through the content to get the A, so you do learn. Every time I have emailed her she has responded quickly and is very helpful. From hearing her in the tegrity lectures she is definitely very passionate about what she is teaching. I recommend this professor and class. ","We were required to read two fairly hefty novels, but they were at least enjoyable. Very clear rubric for assignments, and an \"essay\" was basically a few very informal paragraphs. If you read and watch the assigned material, and write thoughtful and honest opinions, you'll do well. ","The syllabus:  2 tests worth 200 points 1 paper worth 80 points Attendance 10 points \"Extra\" Credit 10 points.  The problem is 1) The extra credit isn't really extra, it counts against you if you don't do it. 2) All you do is watch films, and she rarely expands on them.  Since you only have 2 tests, if you do bad on one, you grade will suffer.","She is a gem. This was her first time back teaching this class again, so she was fiery giddy and all over the place. Not a tough class, if you read the syllabus, make your own notes, and skim the readings (not very long). The only thing you really need to make sure you do is EXTRA CREDIT. It's 10 points, but included in your final grade (total).","If you like sci fi, this course on the anthropology of sci fi is for you.  It's a fun, summer, online course.  The professor is crystal clear about what you need to do to make an \"A.\"","loved this class! she is a great professor. there are only two graded assignments which are the midterm and the final exam. attendance is a must because you will be extra credit if you dont miss more then 2  classes each section. exams are easy. also get extra credit opportunity that equal to another exam to help out your grade.no textbook!","Passionate, caring, awesome in every way.  Students love her!","I like that grades are not just based on tests. Writing assignments can be on readings, museum exhibits, guest speakers, movies, etc.","Dr. Neely is an amazing instructor. I didn't think I would like her class at all. It turned out to be one of my favorite classes.  Her stories beautifully illustrate her lectures.","AWFUL. Do not take here unless you are very interested in the subject matter. She goes off topic all the time and her stories aren't interesting or funny.

There is homework about three times a week but due dates are not hard and he grades not entirely by accuracy. I would recommend Professor Christensen to anyone preparing to take mat229.","Best professor I have ever had. Goes slow during lectures so his students understand. Very few points in the class, so DO GOOD on the tests!!(If you study you should be fine, study guides just like tests) He's a great professor, he's understanding, and he's nice. Not much else to say. Would take him for all my math classes in the future if I could.","Great instructor. He explains things clearly and he is very patient. Light homework\/","We called him C^2. No frills, no tech, just a chalkboard and calculus. He goes slow, explains everything clearly, and has very concise homework that prepares you well for the tests. He's an old school math professor who can seem boring at times, but he covers the content well and makes it easy to learn.","Dr. Christensen is the best professor in the math department. He explains everything clearly and concisely. His homework was balanced and fairly easy if you read the material. The exams were take home so they were very easy.

Overall, sweet man, and I would take his class again because I found it to be an easy A","I have had a lot of bad math teachers, from a pair of long term subs, to overly hard teachers, to overly easy teachers, so the bar was low, but Prof Christensen is truly amazing. He answers everyone's questions thoroughly, no matter how 'dumb', and he's truly caring for his students. He also rounded my grade up which was truly a life saver.","Do the hw and you get full credit and it is worth over 33% of your grade. Late work  100% as long as it's before the exam for the unit. I could've gotten an A but I didn't try after midterm. I am hoping he teaches Linear Algebra so I can have a great professor. Tests have very few questions but you will be well prepared for it. STRONGLY RECOMMEND","The best math teacher I have ever had. Explains concepts very clearly and takes time to answer every question a student has. He gives a significant amount of homework, but the due date is always the day of the exams so you can complete it as you see fit. My only complaint is that he is monotone. I would HIGHLY recommend professor Christensen.","Dr. Christensen is a fantastic professor and is extremely clear with his explanations. He is a tough grader on exams, but his exam format is very similar to the review he posts (they're just old tests). He can be very slow in his explanations and examples, but that makes it really easy to grasp.","Dr. Christensen is a really nice guy and a fantastic math professor, one of the best Ive had. He's very good at explaining Calculus concepts in a digestible manner. Aside from his teaching quality, I really liked that he was flexible on homework due dates. He assigns 2-3 reasonable assignments per week, but will accept them late up to the exam. Hi","This was hands down the best professor I have ever had. The explanations are start simple and build up. Instead of a rigid formal explanation he gives insight as to the thought process that led up to the current concept. Lectures were great and the material could not have been better explained. The homework policy gives time to actually learn.","Professor Christensen is my favorite professor and I took this class specifically so I could have him again. He's very monotone but is a great lecturer. This class in particular is not that hard and is a unique and interesting concept, especially if you're interested in security and ciphers.","Took MAT128 which is my Gen-Ed calculus with him. My only concern is that the tests are very short but they consist of a large portion of your overall grade. However, he's a great guy and good at lecturing. He goes over homework in class and I do recommend him.","I had always heard great things about him, and after having him this semester I can verify that the hype is real. He is not super loud or expressive but he still manages to keep my attention. His explanations are so clear and repeated so many times that it would be impossible to not understand.

Easy A, take it.","Professor Tom does not have too many assignments, however his midterm and exam are ridiculous - 150 + questions, 2 + hours to take!  Therefore, you can get an A on every assignment but not do so well on the exams and get a lower grade than you expected. Prepare to read and know your stuff! ","Professor Edwards needs to retire or learn how to use email, because if you don't contact the head of his department he absolutely will not answer you. I learned a whole lot of nothing in this class, but it was easy and I got an A, so there's that...","He's an amazing teacher and  understands we have a life outside of school.  He posts the assignments so you can work ahead if needed. Very understanding and caring. He's just a little slow at grading.  This is my 3rd class that I've had with him and I hope to have more.","Good online class with great tips on leadership. Late on grading assignments. BB assignments conflicted with syllabus. I should have an A in the class but grades not posted yet.","This is my first online class. LOVED IT! soo easy..everything is straight from the book.  All work is due every monday by 11pm.  I always spent my sunday night doing the work. You read two chapters and then take two quizzes.  Every so often there is a short movie to watch and then write about.

He gives you time to work on essays in class, with a brainstorming day, a draft day, and a peer review day before you have to submit. 4 writing pieces, each 200 points. Very lenient.

His exams are literally 10 short answers and 2 extended responses. They will be over the genre you are reading and the stories you read. It is a very easy class. Classes were just topics.

Often shared personal stories and made almost every story\/poem intriguing. We often referred to him as a CHAD.

He's very easy to talk to and great to ask for help. Attendance is graded.","I took class online and everything was organized and clear. There were three papers for the full semester each had three drafts which made it easier to fix mistakes along the way.

Being in his class was a great experience, and I hope I have the opportunity to take hime again.","Dr. Bishop was one of my favorite professors. He genuinely cares for his students.","Maybe the easiest A ever.  Classes are just discussions about the chapters from the book.  You write a few papers during the semester, and he gives you a rubric so you know exactly what you need.  The final is a paper, which is a very long paper, but also he tells you exactly what to write.  He is also a very nice guy and does know his stuff","Professor Bishop is an excellent professor. He is someone you could listen to all day.  He has a wealth of experience and knowledge.  Anyone who has him should be considered lucky.","He is awesome!

{"Name":"Rebecca Hazen ","Comment":["I pay minimum attention in this class. I took psych in high school but not AP as I did not originally need it. If you have taken psych before, this is the easiest class. If you haven't taken psych before, pay attention to what she says.","Shes super cool. Her class is so easy and shes super cool. The only bad thing is theres lots of powerpoints. She tries to shake it up with some videos and fun personality quizzes, but sometimes an hour and 25 minute class with nothing but powerpoints gets tiring.","Hazen gives only multiple choice tests and a decent amount of possible extra credit. She heavily relies on powerpoint lectures for the class and reviews before every test. A good choice for a gen-ed and a good grade, as long as you pay attention in class.","I went to class because she took attendance, but didn't pay much attention during lectures. She tells you what you need to know for the tests, and you can go through the powerpnts to find the answers to those questions. Tests are pretty easy; she also offered 75 easy extra credit pts. Very little homework which amounted to maybe 30m of time total.","She's a really sweet professor. She really knows her stuff and makes class fun. I'd take her again. We had almost all of our tests online, which made it nice.","She gives very little homework, all semester we had only 5 homework assignments. All very easy. She allows you to skip 6 classes with no grade deduction. She is very funny. Final exam is not accumulative. She will give you a list of everything you need to know before every exam. So easy to pass this class.","Mrs. Hazen is a great professor! She goes over the exams the class period before. The material is very interesting and she incorporates a lot of videos and modern day scenarios to the lessons. Doesn't make this class so difficult that it is impossible to pass. Only mild studying required. She has inspired me to add a neuroscience minor.","Perfect professor if you're taking this for a gen ed! She gives you the topic of each question on the exam the class before the exam, and the final is just the exam on the last chapter. Homework is so basic. DON'T buy the book!","The most boring Psychology course that I've ever taken. Every class is a Powerpoint lecture, with information taken almost directly out of the book. She practically reads word for word off of the powerpoint. If you are a fan of Psychology and want to actually learn something, I suggest taking this course with another professor.","She's an amazing person and teacher.  Super nice, always gives examples that help and she goes over everything that's going to be on the test before the test!!","Easy class, super boring. Barely knows the material, and the powerpoints come almost directly out of the textbook. If you enjoy psych, dont take her,taking it cause you have to, shes a good choice as long as you don't mind having to show up for a class you can easily pass without with mandatory attendance ","one of the easiest psychology classes you will take. It irritated me she graded on attendance because all she does is read right off the power points half the time I don't think she knew the material very well. (had her for abnormal). Don't get me wrong she is really nice and you can pass the class easy if you just show up and listen.","After reading the ratings on this professor I think it depends on what days you have her. If you have her 2x a week then it may get rushed a little bit from what she told us(3x a week). She presents the material well, interesting tone of voice, uses great examples to relate to her lecture material. Great teacher, easy tests if you study.","She has a really bubbly personality and uses real world situations so it's easy to relate to her lectures. She seems fair with her rules and grading criteria, and shows that she's trying to improve as a professor. She started off kind of ditsy and would occasionally slur her words, but that seems to be improving. I would recommend her. ","I regret taking this course with Ms. Hazen.  If you HAVE to take this class, look for a different professor.  Not only does she not clarify her lectures, but it seems like she reads off the PowerPoint slides and that is the extent of her knowledge. She also made us pay 75$ for a textbookonline quiz system (REVEL) that we didn't use once. ","Easiest class I've ever taken. All quizzes are online so you can use your book, she only has 4 exams the whole year. I rarely went to class, maybe once a week & I passed with a 95%.","I would not recommend her. She is very nice, but she always comes in to class not too prepared. She rushes through her lectures and is constanly saying, \"um.\" Her tests are easy enough. I did like how she posted her power points on black board. As long as you have those and study you will pass the class without her lectures.","She goes way too fast during her lectures, she doesn't really engage with students. A lot of the time it seems likes shes just goes on about nothing. She's just very frustrating overall.","Her class was pretty easy, if you come to class, pay attention & go 2 the test review w\/ the teacher assistant you'll get an A. She's young but she knows her stuff & gives real world examples so you can actually use what u learn. And it's not all lecture, she does videos & activities too. I'd take her again.","Her class is all about passing the test. This is great if you're like me and don't intend on having a future in Psychology. Her lectures can get kinda boring, her student aid is more interesting than she is. She has random pop quizzes. But her tests are super easy to pass, minimal homework, and minimal textbook use.

I never stress about the classes that I have her for.","The only teacher I've ever had who is so bad at communicating that it frustrated me to my soul. In order for your e-mails to be answered, you'll have to send it once every 24 hours for 4+ days. To understand her e-mail\/rubric, you'll have to pretend it was written by a third grader and decipher from there. Ask a question and her answer won't help.","Like everyone said, she is very corny and awkward, but nothing you can't get past. She basically has study guides within her notes, and exam questions come straight from that. Very easy if you take the time to actually learn it. She doesnt lecture ALL the time, so teaching yourself is needed, but the content is not that bad, and I liked it. ","Easy A for research, but you won't learn anything. Although, the other classes said they didn't learn anything in research either. Recommend taking for an easy GPA booster.","Have her for 210L and 220. She can be corny to try and help you remember key points.  Very clear on what she wants from you. Lab stays the whole period even if others left early, not a bad thing in nursing. Lectures are kinda boring but she is very helpful!","She's a good teacher- but she does pronounce everything wrong during the lectures. She laughs at her own corny jokes- which then makes you kinda chuckle. She's VERY nice and seems fairly helpful. I would recommend her to others. Tests are right off notes- book is useless.","I hated this class. She posted modules with case studies for us to complete and turn in each week. The longest was 37 pages and the shortest was around 12. She hardly lectured. She spent our 3 hour class asking us practice questions. Everything I learned in that class I taught myself.","Professor Pence's enthusiasm was contagious to learning the material in class.  She made the class fun and easy to learn.  The MP3 files and extra credit points was a plus.  The NIH stroke scale extra credit was nice & I like the certificate that goes with it.  She was helpful in reviewing what I miss on the exams and has a good sense of humor.","We learn research as we go through the class and it makes sense and it is a very fair class!","Her lectures are not dynamic but her study guides are brilliant. Know those and you can get 100s on your tests. Believe me, folks really struggle with all the memorization that this class can demand, especially if the instructor is not specific about what to know.

Great Professor!","Great professor, definitely knows the material and how to teach it. Switched between multiple professors until I found this guy, would definitely take again.","Wonderful guy.  Very nice guy.   If you don't like surprises, don't take him is my advice.  He does try to trick you on exams, he will tell you he likes to challenge you on the exams.   It also takes him a long time to get things graded.  This is okay when you have large classes, but our class was very small and we were taking our first big exam before we knew what we got on our quizzes so you didn't know where you were for weeks at a time.  I really enjoyed him as a professor overall but you will find yourself frustrated at times because he adds concepts to quizzes and tests that he didn't cover in class all that thoroughly or that the homework didn't cover.  This only bothered me because he claims he follows homework when he makes his exams out but he adds concepts that the homework didn't cover, at all. Or he adds items to exams that he BARELY goes over in class.  If you are someone who needs practice and lots of examples in homework to practice & study, him adding concepts to tests that he barely went over, you will struggle.  My advice is to work problems from each section, even the ones he says you don't need,  because he will add stuff.  For example, when we covered even and odd functions, telling if a function is even or odd, etc, the homework doesn't cover those things but he added it to our 2nd exam.  So when you go over a study guide for the exam, he will add things and your like, \"Ummmm our homework didn't cover this,\" so then you basically have to learn new concepts at all once.  Also, when we covered trig functions, he added coterminals to the quiz and that was no where in the section we were being quizzed on so you basically have no real way of studying for his quizzes or exams when he does tricks like this.  I'm doing very well in the course, but him consistently doing this, it got so tiring and frustrating toward finals time.  I feel exhausted because you never know what to expect from his tests.  I think he assumes we are all math experts and know all of this math so studying can be so exhausting when he throws things in without warning us or preparing us adequately.  I never even heard the term coterminal in his class and yet we were quizzed on it, so be warned.","Jim Justice is the best math teacher I have ever had. ever.  If I can take him for other classes I will, no matter how I have to rework my schedule.  He explains the topics so you can understand.

{"Name":"Lee Kersting ","Comment":["Helps you out at every possible opportunity. Extra credit, partial points on tests if youre somewhere in the ballpark, very clear explanations of the material. Make sure you attend class. Dont be afraid to reach out to him, he is very helpful and knowledgeable. I received a B that I may or may not have deserved. Would 100% take again.","Professor Kersting is an amazing professor. His lectures are packed full of information and his tests are rough. Make sure to show up to class because you do problems similar to ones on the test. Mgt Cost is a rough class so be sure to read the textbook and practice the problems and you shouldn't have too bad of a time. Kersting makes it doable.","He is a great professor, and great at explaining things. He always has in class exercises to offer which help alot with studying for exams. Exams are hard, but that's because it's Accounting. If you show up to class you will do fine, I'd definitely take his class again.","Best accounting teacher he wants you to do well and pass you can tell he has his PhD in accounting by how well he knows it and teaches it. He will help you outside of class as much as you want. Hes really smart. Gives extra credit and will give you points on test if you at least try and attempt. wants everyone to do well and pass. Best professor","Great professor! Absolutely should try and take his sections versus other professors. He won't let you down!","Professor Kersting is great! I took ACC 201 over the summer was really difficult for me, but Kersting was really supportive, and was always willing to help whenever he could. He also a big family guy, and had a new baby daughter in the middle of class, so adorable.","Best Professor at NKU, very passionate about teaching\/accounting.  Knows what he is talking about and wants you to succeed!","Amazing Professor. Great teacher who actually cares about students and loves what he does. Would highly recommend him. If you put effort into his class you will be successful. You learn a lot and he makes it as enjoyable as possible. His office is always open and he never makes you feel stupid. Also, puts in effort to get to know each student.","Best professor I have ever taken, I failed this class at UC but passed his class with a B.  Excel project was difficult but he walked me through every step during office hours. He is always available for questions, not many people go to office hours and he loves it when people go!","Great Professor. Tests are very very difficult. He tends to move pretty fast on subjects though, but if you are in need of help he is very willing to help and make sure you understand the material. Does a lot of in class examples that help. Homework is due before every exam instead of evenly throughout the weeks. Uses MyAccountingLab.","Dr. Kersting is the best professor I have ever had. My friends and I called him the Kerstinator because he spit hot fire. I recommend him and this class for any and everyone.  ","Amazing professor.  Willing to assist students and gives prompt feedback.  Lectures are extremely helpful, with homework designed to ensure material is read before class.  The reading assignments are by page numbers to eliminate topics not covered.  Best professor I've had at NKU.","He is one of my favorite professors.  He is fair, and spends time actually teaching.  I appreciate that he has a genuine interest in the subject and wants his students to learn (not just regurgitate the information he wrote on the board).  Class is tough, and requires work.  He facilitates discussions, and actual learning.  AWESOME teacher!!","Smokin hot.  Tests are hard, but he is a great teacher who explains very clearly and is super helpful to students with questions.  No projects, just tests and HW. He applies everything to real world, so that's great","It's true, he's extremely attractive. I think that was why I was so interested in what he had to say and actually passed the course.

{"Name":"Daryl Harris ","Comment":["As long as you participate a couple of times you will be fine. Try to participate more. I'm a more quiet person, but I still enjoyed this class and regretted not putting my opinion out more. Participate! Also, the midterm and final exam are important, so do them properly and put time into them. DO NOT PROCRASTINATE OR YOUR GRADE WILL SUFFER! :)","Dr. Harris is an absolute legend of a professor. No other faculty member I have ever met can make such an incredible experience out of a regular 3 hour class. If you have chance, take this class. It's incredible, and makes you grow as a human while teaching you so much about the world of dramatic human expression.\nGet well soon Professor!","Dr. Harris never failed to amaze me once. This class was a blast. He is always happy and is a very funny guy. He talks about 500mph though so once you get used to that you'll be fine. Great professor, even better class. Get well soon Dr. Harris.","I looked forward going to this class every week. You have to talk about very controversial topics in this class, but Daryl does not judge anyone's opinions and likes to have fun. He does talk really fast or quiet sometimes, but if you ask him to slow down, he will. You have to read a lot of scripts, but you can look up the summaries and be fine.","The professor himself is a nice person, but man, this class was a pain. You have to read a play a week, but there is no actual textbook. There are about 15 plays you have to read. During class time, we discuss the assigned play from the week, but we don't even discuss the play. You can get away with never reading a play, as long as you Google it.","The only negative thing about Daryl is that he mumbles so it's hard to hear him even in a small class room, and he goes off topic sometimes. It's a pretty interesting class, but you HAVE to participate. I didn't talk much and still finished with an A, but you will have to talk some! The grading is heavily based on the midterm and final, so read!","Daryl is easy-going and fun. A bit of a tough grader, especially on the midterm. You can easily get through all the discussions without reading and using Wikipedia. Take this class for an easy a. Attendance is necessary, you can only skip 2 classes.","Read the scripts and participate in discussions. Constantly work on your midterm paper throughout the semester.","He didn't even teach.... He put us into four groups then assigned each group 4 chapters in the book and then give a presentation on each chapter. Class was boring and always got out early. ","Fun and very unique professor - his class is all discussion. As long as you show up and act interested and pipe up from time to time, you will get an A. He is lots of fun and super chill, but he speaks very fast sometimes and can be hard to understand.  But he is always very gracious about slowing down and rephrasing things in a better way :) Fun!","This class was FABULOUS! it really helped to bring me out of my shell and the class became a big group of friends. Daryl works magic to get everyone involved and engaged and thinking! TAKE THIS CLASS. RACE, GENDER, AND THEATER!","If you participate in discussions, this class is super easy. You just have to have reasons for your opinions, and not just spout off stuff.","I had an incredibly difficult time in this class. It is solely based on discussion and if you don't talk you could definitely get a poor grade. I found Daryl very hard to understand and frequently got confused as to what we were actually discussing.","One thing about Daryl's classes: they're rarely boring. If you don't mind going to class every day take this one for an easy GenEd. Show up, speak up once a week and you're halfway to an A. He does tend to mumble but it's worth putting up with for those moments when he blurts out something possibly inappropriate but infinitely hilarious.","Easily one of the most subjective courses I've ever taken. It showed me that the typical structure you find in a class had done more to rein me in and hamper my creativity than I could have imagined. If you're the sort of person who needs strict structure, I'd advise not taking the class. Sidenote: Daryl's voice puts Morgan Freeman's to shame.","Discussion-based course. No tests. No quizzes. You need to do the readings and attend class to get anything out of the class. I'm not very art-oriented, but I still enjoyed the course. Would recommend!","The class was Art for Social Change. His policy is basically if you attend and put forth a good effort while creating quality projects, you get an A. No exams, no quizzes. Just projects and some reading. He's a fun guy and really open-minded. Take him!","Daryl is amazing as a professor and a really interesting man if you give him a chance to talk. he would rather you be enlightened than be able to recite anything we read. it was more about how it effects you as a person and a citizen than what you can remember from the plays. honestly a great man though he doesn't remember your name :D","Daryl is an excellent professor he sometimes gets of topic but is and excellent professor overall","this was for race and gender - darryl is hilarious. he sparks creative thinking and discussion. this was my favorite class all semester. he'd rather have you debate and use your brain than just read something and take a useless exam. group projects are fun. he stays pretty unbiased while discussing very racy topics. take this man!"],"Department":"Theater","Rating Value":3.7,"Rating Count":27,"Would Take Again":0.75,"Difficulty":2.2,"University":"Northern Kentucky University","Link":"https:\/\/www.ratemyprofessors.com\/professor\/503845","Score":0.7542857143}

Such a good, fun class!","This was probably the hardest class I've taken at NKU. Her midterm was the most ridiculous exam I've taken in my life. She's not a bad professor but she makes things way harder than they need to be.","Professor Darnell is a pretty good professor. She's extremely helpful and is passionate about communication. She makes the class fun with interesting assignments. Be aware she does give 2 chapter quizzes each week along with other homework. They are not hard just a lot to keep track of with work from all the other classes you will take.","Other responses didn't show how tough she actually grades. She finds the smallest mistake possible and takes points off. Don't take her if you need a good GPA. There are really no good things I can say about Mrs. Darnell. I had a better time taking Organic Chemistry and Calculus II.","She is difficult to reach outside of class. She also likes to make it seem like the speeches and grades will be very hard, but she is an easy grader. I was terrified of public speaking but I slowly got better throughout the semester.","Professor Darnell was my favorite prof when I had her.

I would definitely take her again!","I was dreading taking this class because I get really nervous talking in front of people. But she made the class enjoyable and comfortable. She's absolutely hilarious and jokes with you before and after your speech to make you more comfortable. Made it my favorite class and I'm not as nervous going up to speak anymore. Would take this class again.","I absolutely love professor Darnell! She has made cmst 101 become my favorite course at NKU and I absolutely hate speaking in front of people. If you're scared of public speaking I would definitely take Darnell's course because she helps you as much as possible. But, there is only one assignment you can make up and only one extra credit assignment.","She's very nice. This class was a little more work than my other com classes but informative.","This was the easiest speech class I've ever had to take. All you need to do is follow the instructions, deliver your speech and you'll do fine. Even if you aren't a great public speaker, she makes you feel comfortable getting in front of the class.","Best Professor I had this year!

His grading requirements are very clear and you know what to expect with each assignment. I'm excited to take him in my future courses.","One of the best professors I've had at NKU! He was very helpful in and outside of class and explained concepts in terms that were easy to understand. He likes to get to know his students on a personal level and enjoys seeing you succeed.

During the lab, he walks around to make sure everyone gets it and makes jokes throughout to ease the stress. BIO 150\/L is not for those that aren't interested.","He explains things very clearly and is always willing to help.  He's also very funny and always available for questions outside class.","Was actually a very good professor. Yes, he was slow at grading but he improved that over the semester. He is working really hard to enhance the class and spend more time in the field than writing lab reports.

He writes out the notes (as he is explaining them) exactly how he wants you to write them because they are structured just like the tests. Tests were open book and identical to the notes. He made class very engaging and I never dreaded coming to class. He made the material funny and entertaining.","This class was super easy but the reason he gets a low rating is that this is an intro-level class and also a gen ed and he made us watch the most disgusting video I've ever seen, it was on sexual violence and completely inappropriate for the class level. It made me sick to my stomach and I'm a nursing major so you know I've seen some things.","I love him, he is a great professor and teaches very well! He takes his time on teaching you the material, gives great notes, and all quizzes and exams are online. You only have to do 2 paper throughout the whole semester, this class is an easy A. I always look forward to this class.","This was a gen. ed. class for me but it was very interesting! The lectures were interactive and informative and I was never bored.","He is a nice guy, but his grading is very HARSH. You have to take notes in the class because all the questions in the exams are from the notes, not the book. For a 101 class, it is the hardest class I have taken and he does not give any extra credit. I would not recommend this class to anyone unless you really have to take him.","Super fun, gives good examples, clear cut, NOTES are awesome"],"Department":"Poli-Science & Crim.

Projects aren't too hard-just be creative and you'll do fine on those.","The professor demonstrates few examples for what is desired from assignments. He is unclear for what he expects and will pick apart responses. Professor Strobel rarely gives full credit for work and changes his requirements after each journal and discussion is posted. The course taken was 5 weeks long, this meant lots of work, less instruction.","Chris was very helpful in the class I took with him.

Tests are pretty difficult but they are open book\/notes and we get 90 minutes to work on them.","This class was a challenge.

Other than that I could tell he is passionate about teaching the material and cares about the success of his students. Theres a lot of assignments, just dont get behind and youll do fine. Take advantage of extra credit opportunities to avoid the final.","Tony is a hilarious professor. There was a never a sad day in his classroom. There is a lot of extra credit in this class, which isn't needed because the class is extremely easy if you've ever used a computer before. There is a good bit of homework that takes a while to complete because the software is very sensitive, but it's not awful.","If you put in the effort you will have no problem getting an A. Professor Burk gives many extra credit opportunities and allows corrections on almost every assignment. The actual class seems repetitive, especially since he goes over the assignments after they are due. Overall I would recommend Professor Burk to anyone taking BIS 101.","Burk is a good guy. He's quirky, which is great for keeping students focused on the material. My only issue with him is how often he says \"okay.\" In the first two classes alone, Burk said \"okay\" a total of 1,407 times. \"Okay? okay. Okay SO, ok today class...\" If you're not easily bothered like me, youll be ok.","Look. I never got this many extra credit in my life. Didnt have to take the final and still had an A.

She is very knowledgeable and really cares about her students.","She will give out many papers to read and write a lot. I wrote 20 pages every week. She is the worst professor out there. I highly recommend students to stay away from her.","105 questions on the tests, 79 multuple questions,20 true and false and 6 essay questions.

I took this class 2 years ago and still remember how inappropriate Jason is. Often making the female students, including myself, uncomfortable in his class.","He paired us for groups and fought with me when I said I needed a new group. My reasoning was when my group members heard me speak positively of a professor they started screaming to the entire library of students that I wanted to F*uck my professor. After this I told him exactly what happened and he refused for a whole week to change my group.","Although kind of an oddball, Prof. Mossman got the job done and taught the stuff well. I was in his EMB-110 course. Attended all the classes. 3 things: pop quizzes over chapters WILL happen, make sure you know APA format, and make sure you aren't late for the exam. Straight up watched him send two people out. I would take it again.","Awesome class, Jason is the best. As long as you show up and participate you'll do fine, just make sure you complete the assignments on Canvas. He takes attendance very seriously so don't skip and be late a lot. A few surprise quizzes but he is understanding and teaches this class in a very entertaining way.","In the beginning of the year, I really enjoyed Jason. I thought he was a good professor and very approachable. My only note is that in the first half of the semester we were assigned 2 MAYBE 3 speeches\/papers, but in the second half we were overwhelmed by around 6 or 7 big things, having to give a speech every week the last 5 weeks of class.","I really enjoyed Jason!! He was an engaging lecturer, and I recommend him to everyone I talk to. As long as you put in some effort it's an easy class. Make sure to buy the textbook and do the reading. Also his syllabus is kind of misleading. He seems really harsh in it, but he's actually super chill.","Jason's awesome. I had him my first semester of my freshman year (for two classes, in fact) and would recommend him to anyone. He's an engaging professor, and clearly cares about students outside of just class. As long as you put some effort into this class, it's an easy A. I personally didn't use the online textbook, but the workbook is a must.","Make sure to practice your speeches and youll be fine. If you struggle, make sure to reach out and ask for help.","Easy class. Just show up and keep your head down or else hes wildly inappropriate.","I loved Professor Mossman. He was funny, helpful, and an overall a very nice guy. Make sure to do the readings when he tells you to, and do your assignments. There is a 24 hour media fast and group project that are most of the grade, but if you try your best, it's not hard to get an A. Definitely would take again.","Professor Mossman is fun and a great professor. Class consists of group discussions and occasional quizzes. The material covered is beneficial outside of the classroom, so I would definitely recommend for an easy A.","Most of the assignment in this class were speeches, this class was a lot of fun and easy if you practice and prepared well, he rewarded you","I enjoyed his class. The class was discussion based around the textbook. There were a couple pop quizes that were incredibly easy if you read, but hard to bs if you didn't. He made lectures enjoyable and very little home other than reading a chapter each week and three ish other assignments. Overall good choice.","Mossman is a great discussion leader and this class is discussion based so that matters, however, he won't force anyone to talk so unless you want awkward silence for 50 minutes, speak up! You MUST read though!!! HE WILL QUIZ YOU and those may make or break your grade. Great in class discussions! Would take a class with him again!","Jason gives a lot of quizzes over the chapters, so make sure you read before coming to class. He is easy to reach outside of class and answers any questions you might have, so it is always clear what is expected of you.","Love","Jason is by far my favorite professor I've had so far. He makes the content enjoyable and easy to understand and remember. He makes the dreaded speech class setting a more comfortable and fun environment and makes each student feel welcome and at ease. If there was something I struggled with or needed a bit more, he was never hesitant to help.","I was initially excited to dig into the content in this course when we first began, however we barely used the (very informational) text and instead had a lot of discussion, which was sometimes decent but for the most part lacking direction. Mossman is a good guy but his students could benefit from clearer expectations and utilizing the text.","Difficult, \"discussion based\" but we have a quiz almost every week and are supposed to read the week before we talk about it.","Jason really wants his class to be discussion based but fails to do so, especially when hes getting mad at students for not knowing material when he hasnt elaborated. He attempted to fail his entire class because he thought they werent reading.

I did most of the extra credit word and was able to boost my grade a great deal.","It is very hard to reach him, if you have a question about an assignment email over a week in advance. I usually don't struggle with essay assignments but his felt impossible. The directions don't make sense and he doesn't make it much clearer after you ask him. His lectures are a blank screen of blackboard where he reads from the book for a while ","His class is really dependent on watching the lectures OR reading the textbooks (his lectures are just him reading the book). I had a hard time figuring out what to do for the essay assignments because the instructions aren't clear. The essay assignments are AWFUL and they took me hours even though I'm generally a fast-paced worker. Not good :(","Dr. Washington encourages class discussion. He is somewhat lecture heavy, but his lectures are very intriguing and based on documented historical evidence.  He guides discussion to encourage independent thought and conclusions. This man is passionate about what he teaches and his methods show it. ","He is so nice and laid back. He actually cares what he is talking about and wants students to be just as engaged with him. If you read the textbook and do the study guides, you should pass fairly easy.","he does not take his time going through any work or task he gives to the class. ","Okay, so if you want an easy class this isn't it. THIS COURSE IS SO IMPORTANT! Also its very interesting! Dr. Washington is compassionate and easy to listen to, laid back and will engage the class. Fill the provided study guides in as he lectures and you have easy extra credit, he offers lots of EC for watching movies outside. Its time intensive.","He's a good teacher and you learn a lot if you pay attention. The class is lecture heavy and he gives you readings(they are free) which you may have to use to fill out your notes. The grading mostly relies on quizzes and 2 exams but he provides so much easy extra credit you'll more than likely have a good grade if you do them. Definitely recommend!","I had to take this class for an elective and thought it would be interesting. Hes a pretty tough grader and wants everything to be exact to his expectations. He does give extra credit though but even those assignments take awhile. He really makes you work for it. Wouldnt take it again or recommend.","His class is not the most difficult because he does have extra credit every week but the wording for his tests is ridiculous. He makes things more difficult for no reason. Try another history teacher if you have to take it.","Dr. Washington is the most intelligent and passionate professor I have ever had. I highly recommend taking all of his courses. He is a true inspiration and I learned so much by taking his courses.","If you are coming to University to learn and history interests you in the least I highly recommend Dr. Washington. He is incredibly intelligent and I truly enjoyed his lectures. He offers extra credit if you're willing to work you will pass with a good grade.","If you do the extra credit and study minimally for the exams, you will perform well. The exams are only worth 10 pts, so it's important that one does the extra credit to get ahead. I recommend taking this course for an easy A. This course is biased, however, and rewrites history in favor of Democrats.","I liked the Professor, material, and his lectures were fine, but you have to write a excruciatingly long paper for the vocab of each test, one test there were like 140 vocab terms, and my paper was roughly 3500 words, only for 10 points. I did great because I love history, but if you dont, this isnt the class for you.","DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!! Every chapter you have to write an incredibly long essay with (am i'm not exaggerating) 75 vocab words that's only worth 10 points! And then a 10 question quiz over a few of those vocab words His lectures are incredibly long and boring and hard to follow. This class was a nightmare","The textbook is hard to understand, is random, and is opinion oriented. Only selective parts of history are covered in this class thus manipulating the facts. The class should not be a forum. For the professors viewpoints.","The textbook was edited by the professor and rather than being a factual course, it is based upon opinion . The class covers material from Darwinism African colonization, US history to African sociology and psychology. The book is difficult to read and jumps all over the place. There are prejudicial opinions in the book. Surprised Nku allows it","Dr. Washington has become one of my favorite professors. He is passionate about what he teaches, he has a good sense of humor, and he gives a lot of extra credit. The work was mostly tests and essays that revolved around vocabulary words from the textbook. The essays could get a little lengthy but he did not grade them very tough. I recommend him.","This guy is straight crazy, but the class is one of the easiest I've been in at NKU. He gives a ton of extra credit & you could just about fail every test and still pass with a B. He is a little skewed when it comes to republican vs democratic views in history, but if you do the research, you can compare truth from opinion.","I loved being in his class.

He basically teaches 5th grade math and gives you college math for homework and exams on top of all that he doesn't give you enough time on exams and his reasoning is because the  exams are open note. extremely strict on grading.","This class is very tough. Definitely the hardest I've taken so far. However, I think Dr. Fox explains things very well and in depth, and is always willing to answer questions. He responds very quickly to questions whether it is through email or a zoom meeting. He does grade pretty tough but after a couple assignments it becomes clear what he wants","The CSC 362 class is a very difficult class that is unlike anything else I have taken in the Computer Science track, focusing on the very base of computer software and hardware. HE does not seem to know how to use Canvas correctly, requires homework to be sent into him by email, and posts all grades out of 0 points.","I took his Computer Systems class and while I struggled a bit in the latter part of the semester, he really cares about his students that want to do well and pass. His tests are fairly long, but they are very doable, assuming you put in the time to study. He explains things very well and is always willing to meet with you, should you need help.","Dr. Fox was an incredible professor. He is very smart and is very good at teaching the class material. The class is a little cramped but he still got through everything without having to skip over anything too much. He genuinely cares about the success of his students. He is a hard grader, but a fair one.","I took this class specifically so that I could have him as a professor again. His classes are incredibly challenging but there is no chance of you finishing the course not understanding the course material as long as you worked on the homework. Generally a fair grader and is always willing to help you with any topic you don't understand.","Fantastic professor! He really cares about his students and does his best to make sure everyone understands the course material.","He really cares about his students and will always be there to give detailed explanations to any question you have. Would definitely retake him.","Dr. Fox is a genius. This class wasn't too bad, but programming in old languages was a bit of a struggle because of how few resources there are out there. There are quite a few assignments but no tests. The final was essentially just asking us what we thought of the class. It's a fun elective if you have room for it.","Dr. Fox is a superb professor. He knows what he's talking about and is able to answer basically any question. If he doesn't know then he says that rather than making up some answer. The class was incredibly difficult though. He taught it well, but there is a TON of material in it so nothing gets particularly focused on.","Dr. Fox is a very good instructor; he explains things very well, is very knowledgeable, and advocates your success. I was a little bit put off by how hard his tests are and how hard he sometimes grades things, but he is otherwise a very good instructor. From my experience in Fall 2016, he didn't enforce attendance, but he strongly encouraged it.","Dr. Fox is a very excellent professor. If you miss more than one or two classes, you'll definitely be struggling, unless you're already an expert at this stuff. I feel like he really tried to make his office hours clear and open. Anytime I asked for help, he lead me down the right path. Don't be afraid of CSC 362. Fox is there to help.","Test are super hard, our class average for the fist one was in the 50's. However, there is an endless amount of extra credit you can earn on the dis. boards. Labs can be long and boring.","This is a tough class because of all the information that needs to be covered.  Dr Fox offered plenty off extra credit with the discussion boards so make sure to do all  of them. The tests are extremely tough because the are over 5 chapters each. Very knowledgeable, he wrote the text book. Great Professor!","This class was extremely tough, but not because he is a bad teacher. The reason this course is difficult is because there is such an unbelievable amount of material to cover, at no fault of the professor. Dr. Richard Fox is unarguably the best teacher I have ever had.  I learned more in this class than in the entirety of high school. ","VERY knowledgeable and good at teaching. Quizzes are online, timed, and open book, but they are difficult. Suggest studying before hand and marking pages for quick reference. LOTS of extra credit opportunities. Not an easy course, some effort is required, but overall it is not terrible. So keep that in mind.","Very laid back but genius professor. He even wrote the required textbook. Lectures do leave a lot to be desired. Very hard quizzes\/final, very easy labs. Offers tons of extra credit.  You will pass his class if you try.  However, he fails to make the subject interesting. Cant say I recommend him but there are much worse professors at NKU.","Dr. Fox is a very good professor. He will go out of his way to help you succeed in his class. In this class, quizzes are very difficult, but he gives numerous opportunities for extra credit. I got over 100 points extra credit just by doing discussion board posts. I never scored higher than an 80% on any quiz all semester and got a B+ in the class.","Dr. Fox is one of the best professors in the computer science department.

You just did weekly discussion posts and the expectations she holds you to are always clear. She's lenient on late work if it's a day or two late; she just wants you to turn it in and get credit for it. The only annoying thing was that she sucked at grading on time. I rarely knew my grade throughout the semester","Dr. Kent-Drury is very knowledgeable in subject matter. I took her for Western World Literature 1. I enjoyed her class.

Yes, she is a bit frazzled at times, and the feedback she provides isn't always useful, but she is incredibly kind and passionate about poetry. Her classes are very student\/discussion-driven, but I enjoyed that. I have gotten an A in every class I've taken with her.","Assignments graded too late in term (giving no idea how we were doing). No useful feedback on writing assignments. What little there was, was not constructive-- lots of \"good\" comments, did not catch things that classmates did pick up.

There's a lot of printing and lot of workshopping\/discussion.","Good professor, not the most interesting course.

It's a creative writing class and I got zero feedback on my work from her. And the class has less than a week left now and there's still not a single grade posted... so I have no idea what I have in this class.  ","I enjoyed Creative Writing Online very much. My only problem was that she did not post feedback or blackboard grades the entire semester, so I was left wondering how I was doing until the very end.

He is awesome at helping you unleash your writing potential.","Very helpful . you will actually learn in his class. understanding and can be flexible. you will have to show effort.","I took him online, and he literally did nothing. Our final paper was our only assignment worth a significant number of points.  And I've never had a professor who wrote such incoherent emails.","I took Weller for my first ever online class, and he made everything so easy.

He went above and beyond what I had expected. At first he was intimidating, but he is a great guy. He was always open to questions and was willing to meet outside of class. I wish he was teaching more creative writing classes! I never saw myself as a writer until I took him. I highly recommend his class.","Professor Weller has a unique and interesting way of entertaining his class, there was never a dull moment this semester. The assignments are challenging in a way that makes you a better writer. Overall, Professor Weller is an understanding, awesome, down-to-earth guy. I'd definitely take another class with him. ","He is a very good professor and down the earth person. Will highly recommend for any English class he teaches. He will read to class openly from textbook and values class opinion. He will work with anyone just have to talk to him. Assignments run late sometime but he will make time  to go over your work if you need him to right away.","Hands down, the best professor I have ever had for English in my entire life. He was amazing. He made writing fun, and let us be free in what we chose to write, which I found very helpful. He's funny and sarcastic, also a plus. We also watched awesome movies and KING OF THE HILL in that class. LOVE HIM","Would definitely recommend. He is sarcastic which I liked. His assignments can be confusing, but he clears it up if you ask him. Very helpful. Listen to him and do what he says and it will be an A.","Prof Weller is a difficult instructor. He was condescending and arrogant at times. This class was supposed to be on writing, but the special topic \u201cViolence in Movies\u201d took over the class. I learned more about movies than I did about writing a paper. I was frustrated throughout the entire semester and couldn't wait for it to be over.","Very knowledgeable.  Sarcastic humor that I loved.","This guy made a big impression on me. I never knew I had a talent for writing until I had his class. I learned a lot from him and he still sits in my head and encourages me to write, even though I am now in the military, i still have that spark. thanks Weller.","I would definitely recommend this class. I found Weller to be very helpful, and the class to be rather enjoyable. The atmosphere of the class is very laid back. If anything is ever unclear he is more than willing to explain.

You have to be a mind reader, or ask LOTS of questions.","Not clear on deadlines, students do not all have same opportunities, class was canceled several times and substituted online (I took in class for a reason.) would not recommend with him.","Andy is a great professor. You need to be an active participant in class though or else he feels less willing to help you (understandably). There's a ton of reading and writing but that that just comes with this class.

I had him 2 times in one semester and I feel very lucky.

I missed class once, but kept up with the reading and was fine. I tried to take another of his classes this semester, but couldn't fit it in my schedule.","Dude obviously knows his stuff and how to teach it...

No tests, we read five graphic novels that were interesting and watched a lot of clips\/movies. He grades the essays pretty harshly, but overall it is a good and interesting class.","Fun class! Very engaging professor. Not planning on being a professional writer, but will use a lot of his ideas in my classroom as a future English teacher myself.","This is an excellent, engaging course. As a bonus, Miller is funny and easy on the eyes.","Take Poetry Writing with him! It's a great & easy class. You'll learn a lot from the workshops. Very laid back class, but that could've been because it was a night class. Still, really enjoyable class!","Myth and Magic sounded like an interesting class. Although, he is rude and not clear on his assignments.  Be prepared to read a novel a week.  In all honesty, he was a jerk and I will never take one of his classes ever again.","Myth and Magic is a really interesting and fun class.

This is the only class I've had with her but I would take another one if needed.","Took her SOC 320 class, was completely our of the textbook. You read the chapter and then do the activity at the end of the chapter in a discussion board post. As long as you read the chapters you'll be fine but she is not very involved in the course.","There is a lot of reading for this course and discussions to complete, but I personally learned a lot from this course.

She's very knowledgeable and as long as you do the weekly assignments you'll pass with an A no problem!","Only really grades Friday discussion boards for supplementing and if you dont do them youll fail. Dr. Grant is a really sweet lady but a very boring lecturer after a while. Her voice just puts me to sleep.","When I am in this class, I wish I was unconscious.

I literally pray that Jesus comes back to earth before I go into that class in hopes I won't have to go. Easy A tho.","The thing was Professor Grant is she is truly a great educator. She is heavy on discussions because she wants to hear what you have to say. She is extremely respected and she is very personable. She uses upwards of 4 textbooks which seems like alot but they are riveting pieces of text that are really the foundation of your sociological perspective.","This professor tends to focus on her viewpoints, and picks specific content to discuss in class that appears to back up her viewpoint. She assumes everyone in there are like minded individuals with very little differentiation in thought. Never opened the textbook as it is useless. Just use google online and you'll be fine. DONT RECCOMEND.","Not good at answering emails. The lectures don't have anything to do with assignments\/tests, therefor going to class is kind of pointless.

This man is a genius, I have truly learned so much from him. I will miss not having him next semester. I love, love, love him!!!","The class was rather boring. He was a funny and interesting professor but his teaching style was very much a bore. Used a lot of slides and didn't really communicate well","Took him for Methods, easy class. Uses powerpt which is boring and he will stare at you and you just have to look interested in what he is saying. Hates cell phones-don't use during class! Gives lots of quizzes-no tests, quizzes straight from his already answered study guide. He's quirky but easy, definitely take him!!!","I love Dr. Hogan. hilarious man and very smart. He is not afraid to say what he wants, and be careful because he can be serious too. Most of the time though, he is fun to joke with. He will know who you are so if you see him in the halls he will stop to talk. very nice man. quizzes are easy- he gives you the answers!","Dr. Hogan was great at the beginning of the semester.  However, he wears his emotions on his sleeve and you can certainly tell when he's having a rough day.  The class is boring and isn't well organized.  I've never failed a class in my entire life but I guess there's a first for everything?.","Dr. Hogan is smart, funny, and a good teacher. He really knows his stuff. I loved this class, because I learned a lot, and he cracks me up. It is not that hard. Just come to class, and do the work.","He is a very nice man. The class is not to hard because he gives you the quiz to find the answers ahead of time. So if you do it then it's easy breazy. He doesn't tolerate stupidity, or what he thinks it is. Shows a lot of really old movies and requires a 10 min oral presentation :(","Nice, funny, smart, a little eccentric. The material is a little tedious, but he gives the test and answers for study guides.","This class is torture.  He knows the subjects but its all I can do to actually focus and stay awake at the same time.  You have to study for the tests and the book is not entirely necessary.  Horrible combination of required class and extremely boring teacher.","Class is extremely boring, does play favorites and many women in the class say they feel he looks at them like a ****ed fool.

I had Dr. Hogan in the 1990s, and he was smart, friendly, and a wild sense of humor. A cool guy that furthered my interest in psychology and my career.

Easy class: go online and start the lab or homework assignment and leave when class is over. If you're stuck or confused, he will help.

I found it difficult to pay attention to his lectures, but to be fair the content isn't exactly that exciting. He gives lots of extra credit. Tests are SUPER hard.

Extremely boring class due to the content, Gonnella generally makes it even more boring. 15 quizzes throughout semester, all easy - he'll give you the answers to most of the questions during the quiz anyway. 3 exams, not difficult if you pay slight attention during lecture.

But I still received an A-.","He is very passionate about this class. He will go out of his way to explain topics and give examples on how to use the material covered. Some lectures are a little boring and pointless, but due to the lack of material in the class, they are needed. Would take again.","This is an advanced excell class.  Not an easy class to take (if you don't use it everyday) or teach.  Classes are boring but he tries to liven it up a bit.  Seems to really care for the students.  Do the homework and study for exams.  The time to complete the homework was greater than the amount needed to pass exams.","This class was pretty boring, most people in the class already knew how to do everything (basic word,pp,excel things) so I never paid attention to his lectures. Its an easy A if you pay attention, B if you show up","Mr. Gonnella is one of the kindest professors you will take.

Did not grade clearly: gave grades on papers but did not say what was wrong.","I would highly recommend her class to anyone who needs a 300 level course because it is extremely easy.  There are 4 small papers and a project at the end of semester, no tests.  She also gives you 10 extra credit points if you don't miss a class. She is super nice and is an easy grader.","Don't take her unless you have to. She's very intimidating and doesn't remember half of what she says. The four small papers weren't hard, but the end of semester project was a pain. Luckily, she doesn't grade too harshly. She doesn't call off class (even when there's plenty of snow) but instead sends a sub, and she's almost always late","One of the best classroom experiences I have had to date. She cares that you learn something and not just about scores. All assignments are geared for you to have new experiences or viewpoints. Easy grader since that's not the point but if you participate you will gain value from the experience. EDU majors this is a must!","Great teacher.   Yes, she was late, but she mentioned on the first day that she probably would be.  The presentation of the class allowed for a lot of discussion.   She presented a lot of different viewpoints.   This particular class is made better with active class participation.","She would consistently show up 10 minutes late for our class. She doesn't really teach very much. She'll start a conversation in class and just let everyone talk. Lots of videos, and she knows nobody reads the book.

Discussions and quizzes are the only grades outside of the exams. ","Weekly discussion boards and two exams were the only grades. The grading made no sense at all. He'd be ok with something one week, but not the next and randomly took off points. The exams are MC, but are really long with not enough time to answer, but basically word for word from the lectures which are online. Hated the lockdown browser too. ","The subject matter itself is not that hard, some of the material is hard to understand, but you can get by. However, the only grades you receive are from quizzes and tests and there are not very many of them. Also, all the quizzes are worth 8.32 points or less, so they do not really help your grade much. Take your time and study as much as you can.","Lot of reading, but its a Philosophy course so expect a lot of reading and discussing.

I 100% recommend it. If you show up to every class and take notes it's an easy A. There are weekly discussion boards and quizzes not too hard if you pay attention in class.","Mr. Brice was excellent, you have to pay attention, and you must take notes. The books are going to be boring, because they were written like eons ago so come into the class with the idea that there will be lots of reading.

If you didn't get a good grade on one of the three exams, you'll fail. Some concepts you learned you never had the opportunity to apply until an exam. The lectures were good, but you were pretty much on your own for most of it.","I liked this professor, but not the class. There was a lot of boring readings, but he goes allows you to go over the quizzes before taking them, which helped a lot; and they arent hard. There was only 10 quizzes, a midterm, and a final.

Tests  easy if you studied.","I took this class online, and maybe it would be better if I took a physical class, but it was an awful class.  The online lectures weren't awful, but there is an awful amount of reading horribly boring books and excerpts.  The midterm and final barely reflected what we read.

Very open minded to any opinions in in-class discussions.","Each week you have to read long philosophy books (that don't make sense). Don't take unless you like philosophy, not an easy credit.

Homework doesn't take long. Not a very tough class. She is an awesome teacher for people who cannot math","She is awesome. She makes sure that you understand every bit of what is going on in the lecture. If you are taking MAT 119, I recommend her without any hesitation.","Assumes you know what she is talking about immediately and skips sooo many steps on her explanations so you lose her fast. Would not take again if my life depended on it. Also prepare for her to fuss about technology for half the class. Also her notes are the biggest jumble that has ever existed.","She may be educated, but she certainly can't portray her knowledge to others. There was an elderly man in my class and she treated him like he was stupid because he didn't understand. Also, don't smile in that class because she'll yell at you. Don't say FOIL, because THAT'S completely wrong. She makes you say First Outer Inner Last.","I was a School Based Scholar in HS, and had Ms. Jump for Mat 119 AND 129. Yes, she know what she is talking about, but if you ask her a question or tell her you don't understand she will go back and try to explain it. You cannot expect her to know that you don't understand. I LOVED her and her class. If I could I would take it again.","She is awful! If you are not a math person DO NOT TAKE HER!

There are only 3 tests and literally every question was taken from quizlets. The work was really easy, but he is kind of picky on it.","This class was easy. Not going to lie, but the professor himself is a joke. Grades are sent via email, most unorganized class ever, dude said he accidental missed the deadline to give final grades... they are still not entered. Such a joke. Also be prepared to buy expensive textbooks and buy Microsoft 2013. ","Alright teacher, for an online class follows the rubric and the work is easy.  If you don't do everything they way he wants it done even if you do it right he counts it wrong and takes points off.","The class material is very dull and boring to read, that being said Professor Scott does have a very well organized syllabus which he follows perfectly, so there are no surprises.  I took the accelerated online class, which made the reading ovewhelming (105 pg\/wk) on top of assignments ands and 3 tests. Wouldn't recommend taking online.","He does not \"teach\" anything.  You pay $150.00 for an online book with access to a website.  His lessons are read this and this and complete this assignment. He has put zero effort into this class. Do not take this class if you are not already a moderate user of Microsoft Office.","He's a good professor.  He knows what he is doing.  Follow directions very carefully on the assignments, or you will get marked off significantly on your grade.","this is generally an easy class. he takes attendance everyday but you only need to go if there is an in class assignment or test. grade consists of 7 in class assignments and three tests. for each test we get a study guide that usually has the exact questions. everything that is due you must do in class the day that it is due or he will not accept","Very nice professor. Classes are really boring though but it's not his fault. Attendance is not mandatory and the powerpoint notes are on blackboard. tests are really easy. the class might be a little better online.","Class was pretty easy, just keep up with work.  He takes off a lot of points for a little mistake, but its an easy A or B if you try.  He is very nice and helpful, Access is really hard though, so pay attention when you get to that.","Gary was a good teacher. This class is very easy but for alot of people that do not know much about microsoft office especially the new 07 version its helpful to take because you can learn how to use it espeically if you are used to the older ones. Gary is very helpful if you have any questions and he lets you do what you want on lecture days.","This class is easy, but mind numbingly boring.  Professor Scott is extremely helpful and his class isn't very hard, but horribly boring.  Make sure to go to class at least once a week, and you'll be fine.","Gary's class is very easy and simple.  Just follow along with the book he goes slower than most people need but makes the class easier.  He is very thorough.  Will take off points if you are late and miss certain amount of classes.  Very Fun and EAsy","Good teacher, nice guy, get there on time, very particular about the material but you have to be.","He is really nice but the voice is monotoned. His test questions tend to not be anything you've talked about throughout class. You will get a weekly homework assignment. I think he grades every little detail and that brings down your grade but he is worth taking.","This class is the definition of boring.  He is very monotone and its hard to concentrate.

The tests always have a curve..","must go to class he takes attendance everyday but the material is super easy. an easy A.","He so boring and monotone, but he knows the material and will not leave anyone behind. Easy A whether you know the material already or not. He curved every test and takes lots of homework grades.

If you pay attention and write good notes you should be fine, but if you take bad notes you're screwed. Follow everything he says and write it down.","I would definitely take him again! The homework sets were graded but useful because you could practice. He is a genuinely nice person. The only hard thing is that he doesn't have slides so you have to write down anything he says! But that was good for me because it kept me focused during lecture! The exam on bonds was the hardest but the rest is ok","It's a difficult class in general so can't fault Krapl for that. He does well really teaching the material you need to know for the HW (3) & Exams (3) - Only Grades.. Take plenty of notes.. sometimes he'll lose you because there's so many terms and formulas so follow along. Test 1 is the easiest, DO NOT SLACK AFTER THAT FIRST EXAM.. it gets tough!","I would attend classes, I could tell when I missed a few as I felt like I fell far behind. Four test and 6 hard copy homework assignments (3 are graded). Do not utilize Blackboard\/Canvas so you have to keep track of your own grade throughout which isn't difficult to do.. every test is 25 questions and structured similarly as is homework.","He has gotten rude since the beginning of the semester. He has not answered multiple question that I have asked. He won't meet outside of class to answer questions. He cut the final short and few people actually finished the exam. Currently he is the only professor for this class unfortunately.","So far he's a great teacher. He is very personable and very common sense minded. I almost wish I had more Finance classes to take because of him.   5\/5... Would sign up again.","Great professor!","I really liked Dr. Krapl. He was funny in lectures, and very helpful if you needed it. He established exactly what was important for the class, and then spend abundant class time teaching (and re-teaching) it. Homework, quizzes, and tests all shared the same basic structure and content.  If he didn't mention it in class it was not on the test.","He's a very nice teacher, but the subject matter was difficult for me.  Many of my classmates that were finance majors really liked him.  I had a hard time understanding, but he answered all of my questions and emails very quickly.  The tests were difficult but 2 projects, that were worth as much as the tests, saved my grade.","Seriously the worse Finance professor I have ever had I seriously think Devoto is better yet I feel they are equally as hard.

Online exams over every chapter.","Very good professor. She has every ability to make the class fun and easily tops the cake in the Education department.","Dr. Noll is a really helpful professor.  If you meet with her one on one, she will make sure you understand and are prepared for what you need.  ; I wish I could take her in a class that was more interesting.  She is a good professor, but she gets stuck with difficult topics.","Truly the WORST professor I have EVER had in my entire life!  She is the epitome of what is wrong with education today.  Obviously knew someone to get her current position as she is the MOST unprofessional, unintelligent, uninformed, and lazy \"teacher\" I know.  I have learned nothing from her and doubt I ever could.","Class normally consists of Power Point lectures.  She does have some activities here and there. Tests are online, but hard! Feel like things we covered in Power Points weren't on the test. No homework besides Virtual Child. I enjoy her class, funny personality.","I love Dr. Noll to death, but her class is super hard. She lectures every day and yells at us for not doing well on the test when she gives us trick questions. Aside from the grades, she's a great person and hilarious as she's constantly making fun of herself. If you take this class be prepared to study a lot!","If you like to know what your grades are, don't take her because she does not grade anything in a decent amount of time.","All of her tests are online--but don't let it fool you. They are the hardest tests I've ever taken. You can look up every single answer and still not pass. In class, she is great though!","Dr. Noll is awesome! She is so funny and enthusiastic. I would love to take her again. Her tests were all online and pretty challenging, actually. With assignments--let's just say papers due in September still have not been graded.","I had her last semester and deliberately took her again.  She's an awesome professor. She is hilarious.

{"Name":"Jan Gallagher ","Comment":["She is understanding if you need to miss a class. That being said, if you miss a class you are going to regret it because you need to hear the lecture. The tests are pretty difficult and you're going to dread taking each one but if you read you'll do ok. There is also not much homework besides reading and a writing assignment. Would not take again.","Whenever I approached her for hep, she was very rude and not helpful in the least bit. She basically reads the textbook word for word during lecture. The tests are pretty difficult, and a lot of the time, you're not exactly sure what to expect. Blackboard materials would be useful. Would not recommend at all.","I had reservations about this class, but after the first class I found it very interesting. She was very clear on what we need to know and reviewed before every test. I thought she had a good sense of humor and was very understanding about obligations outside of class. Study your notes and you will get an A.","She's a little nutty but her \"off-topic\" rants always relate to the subject matter and usually involve her extensive world travel. She practically reads from the book, so I can't understand why some people did so poorly. It's college: go to class and study and you'll do well. 7 page research paper and presentation required, non-cumulative final.","She gets the point across through various rants that sometimes go off topic.  She's a zany little lady.  Very hard to approach because she always seems (and is) hostile.  Almost as if you were an inconvenience to her life.  She'll then smile at you as if it never happened the next time you talk...  Zany lady.","I had a hard time with this course. I'm very visual, she doesnt us blackboard at all or powerpoints or hand outs making it hard to follow sometimes. She only gives tests and they were super hard.","She is a very good professor. I I hardly studied for the test and got high C's on all of them. She  is very funny I really enjoyed her class. I didn't take a lot of notes but if you went to class right before a test she went over everything. don't bother to buy the book you will never use it. its a waste of money. TAKE HER :)","Ive been taking Health Ethics for the past month. just got a 74% on the test and I dont ever get C's. She provides NO studyguide and admits 2 trying 2 trick u on the test. Shes a very nice, outgoing lady but Im not used to her teaching style. The class is extremely boring and hard 2 go to 3 times a week. I would try to get around taking the class!!","She's a spitfire, which makes this class fun. However if you ask her a question she seems put off by it, or even answering something you had originally thought was right but was wrong she'd also look at you as though you were stupid. She's very intelligent and amusing for classes which makes it interesting, but she's also rude to students.","She can be rude to students.  But her tests are easy enough that you just need to spend an hour studying them. A lot of it is just plain common sense. She's very understanding of obligations outside of class (i.e. sports, family, dr's appt., etc.) I would take her again.","I enjoyed her lectures and stories. Very funny lady. She does demand your undivided attention which isn't too much to ask. If you give that to her, she's cool. Tests are fairly easy.  My strategy is to quickly write what she says in class and rewrite my notes neater in outline format.  I didn't think note taking was too bad. I would take her again.","Yeah she keeps class interesting, but you can fall asleep at times.  But you really learn a lot, and it is an easy B if you don't try hard. She really deserves Thumbs up.Extra credit available.  We used book in class, but test were straight from notes. And not sure what to write half the time but listening to her can help to,PAY ATTENTION","A litte nutty, but that's what makes her fun! Insanely easy class. She gives reviews that basically ARE the tests. Won't tolerate loud\/annoying students and will give them strange looks which is funnt!!! DO NOT BUY THE BOOK you will never use it. Just study off her guides. Scantron quizzes, 4 of them, plus 2 papers that will take 10minutes TAKE HER","She is a very strange person, but overall the class was easy.  she is very opinionated and her tests reflect her opinion, so study that and you will do ok!","This class is useless.  You learn nothing.  And don't have an opinion (or if you do, keep it to yourself!) Which is easy because there is no discussion.  You just listen to her talk, mostly.  She can be funny at times. Doesn't really like being asked questions, and hardly ever gave a straight answer.","this is the easiest class you will ever take, i took her for health care ethics and got an a... dont buy the book, you dont really have to go to class, but everything on the test she talks about in class, most is common sense, she is weird though!","After the first day of class I wanted to drop but I decided to stick it out and in the end I'M VERY GLAD I DID! She ended up being a very interesting person to listen to. She is even kinda funny at times! VERY VERY EASY A!","Very easy class, BUT she is strict and lashes out if you question her.

{"Name":"Greg De Blasio ","Comment":["Good teacher with lots to say, and knowledgeable about many topics. Is willing to accommodate to student's needs, and will help you. Quite a few speeches based on sections of the books we have to read. Will talk and tell stories for a while, but it isn't in a lecture kind of way. Cares about students, and not too many assignments at all.","Greg is a very nice person. He is a clear Expressive (if youre familiar with Social Styles) and has many ideas and thoughts flowing a mile per minute. This is why some people say hes unorganized and all over the place. However, he is extremely knowledgeablenot only in the PR realm, but in many aspectsand is willing to help whenever needed.","De Blasio is wonderful, get to know him and show him you care about your education and he will do whatever he can to help you. My top advice would be if you are confused just stay after class to talk to him, he is great 1 on 1.","De Blasio was a wonderful professor, I learned more from him than any other professor at NKU. He truly cares about his students and always has a good story to tell. I have personally seen him walk through assignments and exams with students to get them the best grades as possible. He is an extremely underrated asset to the PR program.","Dr. De Blasio is an animated fellow who teaches in a way that leads students to their own conclusions. Some say he doesn't set clear expectations, but I believe that to be an open door for students to get creative. You'll leave his class with a better vocabulary and a good idea of what you'll need for a solid portfolio when seeking a career in PR.","Very knowledgeable about PR, but the class itself lacks organization. He has very unclear expectations but is more than willing to answer any questions. Just always be ready for anything in his class. His Lecture are ok most days.","He is clearly very knowledgeable about the subject of PR, but he feels stuck in the past of the field and has trouble simplifying his expectations. He doesn't post grades online (ever) and assumes group projects can get done in a singe day.","I love Greg, I honestly really look up to him. He knows what hes talking about. He has some really good stories from all sorts of different things hes done (ask him about causing the police to purchase riot gear after pretending to book The Who when he was in high school, haha). Yes, he's a tough grader, but show that you care and you will be fine!","I can't begin to describe the lack or organization\/communication in this class. While he does provide a schedule in the syllabus, do not expect to follow it AT ALL. He gets off track and you have no idea when a project really is due. At one point he announced the night before class, that a 3 page paper was due the next day. No respect for students!","Currently in PRE 377. I am not sure how I am doing as well as I am. He provides no clear direction on what he wants from you. He posts a 5 page midterm paper with only a couple of days and he explained what would be on the midterm by shrugging his shoulders and saying \"what we've talked about\". He is a very nice person but essentially just rambles.","I had Greg for PRE 376 and PRE 400. If you think Greg is hard, get out of this field because this is a glimpse of the real world, no one is going to hold your hand with this stuff and neither will he. He does get very off topic, but you will leave his class with a great portfolio of work. You will get an A if you be creative, guaranteed. ","Literally the most difficult class I've ever had. This class was not helpful at all. He would go on random rants about PR that had nothing to do with the class and then all of a sudden tell us to \"budget this PR account and create a campaign\" without ANY guidance. I fought for my B!","TERRIBLE DON'T TAKE HIM! Avoid him at all cost.","I loved Deblasio! Everyone tried to talk me out of taking him, glad I didn't listen! He was an amazing professor and had a lot of interesting topics to talk about. Class was never boring!!! He is appropriately challenging for those who do not like homework I wouldn't recommend but for those of you that are realistic and know it's college and it's challenging he is amazing and I recommend him!","I was scared to take Greg by the rumors on here. I took Greg 3 TIMES! in one semester so i could graduate on time. It was alot of work but I learned alot and, Yes I recieved B's in all three classes. He makes you work and is very motivated and very knowledgable. He helps students with internships as well.","Basically like they said, if you want an A good luck. Taking both PRE 377 and 376 made my life a living nightmare. There's too much work in the beginning and then the take home exams don't really make sense to the class. If you're lost on the exams you don't really have a chance. The effort it takes to get even a B is ridiculous.","He is a fun guy. Very liberal, and not ashamed of it, but he knows his stuff. He has a tendency of rambling. He is very likeable and helpful. The assignments you do are useful for the real world; I learned a lot in this class. 6 assignments worth 65%, midterm and final worth 35% (both were take home). 3 group assignments- you pick the groups.","Really liked this class, got an A but had to work for it.  I learned a lot and feel in the future I can go to him for help. Work hard in this course and you will get the grade you deserve","very unorganized","Grading scale is ridiculous.

Watch the lectures for sure and do the readings.","Let me start by saying Im sure Callie is a great person. She is very nice. However, as far as teaching this class it was awful. Straight reading from PowerPoint with no extended explanation. Readings are photo copies of old hard to read texts that are very relevant or up to date. Projects have unclear instructions. Dont take","Lectures are read directly from the powerpoint, almost no deviation at all. They are dry and boring. No tests, but lots of discussions on topics that are not expanded on. Reading the materials is the only way to get information, as lectures take heavy influence from the book. If you don't understand the topics in the book, the lecture won't help.","She found a way to take away any enjoyment that I had in this class. I was excited for this class, but it was all about comparing pop culture with folklore. We didn't dive into any folklore if that's what you're looking for. The one project that I was excited for wasn't good enough for her. It was the most boring class that I have ever taken.","Love Professor Clare. She's so quirky, fun and genuine! She's super helpful as well. Basically if you always go to class, participate in class convo's (usual funny), and take notes, studying for\/doing well on tests are no problem.

I had high expectations for the class, being that it is typically fun. No, this class was not at all. We didn't watch a single film the whole semester. The videos she showed were quite boring. I would not recommend taking this class unless it is required for your major. ","She made up this term \"Funhouse Mirror\" which has no meaning at all. And then goes on to talk about it for the rest of the semester. Never talked about pop culture, only concepts.","Really enjoyed this class. All notes are on the board, and she does expect you to read (short readings). Very nice and encourages participation and everyone's ideas to be heard. Checks to make sure nobody has any questions over the material and if they do, tries to explain the info in different ways. Easy class if you pay attention. Recommend.","I love Callie!

DO NOT take this class and if you have to, change to a different professor!","Good professor but needs clearer expectations and more time on tests. Never gave expectations for discussion posts, so people wrote \"don't know what\/how to discuss.\" Tests required deep understanding of all seven books read. Only did well because can read and write well and fast. But had informative lectures and good time management  good grade.","MAKE SURE THAT YOU READ THE BOOKS THAT SHE ASSIGNS AND GO TO CLASS SO THAT YOU CAN GET NOTES ON THE BOOKS AND THE HISTORY BECAUSE ITS ON THE TESTS THAT SHE PUTS ON","Dr. Kapadia does not care about her students opinions or circumstances. She yelled at a student who clearly had ASD\/some other social disability on our FIRST day of class. DO NOT TAKE HER.","Shes a mean professor who gives back unnecessarily sarcastic feedback that never helps, and if you ask for help she will always shoot you down or embarrass you in front of the class. Honestly shouldnt be a professor.","I had Dr. Kapadia for Film and Lit and Advanced College Writing. She is one of my favorite professors on campus; a reason I look for her classes specifically. She's fairly serious, but she is also really witty. She does care a lot about her students, especially students that are serious about her classes.","We only had discussion posts & 3 tests as our assignments. So not a lot of opportunities to redeem yourself if you do poorly on a test, which SUCKED. You also have to show up to pass. But she is an AMAZING teacher. I absolutely love her lectures. I learned so much and I would take her again if I could.","She has got to be one of the worst professors on the campus. She gives no rubric on how she grades the essays and even when you fix the notes she gave you, she just gives you more and doesnt bump up your score. Every time we got essays handed back I would here Another C!?!? around the class. She tries to justify herself by grading everyone hard.","Worst proffesor I've ever had! Dr. Kapadia shoots down eassay ideas and compains about not wanting to teach. She calls students out and her grading criteria is unclear. You're allowed to miss two classes, if you miss any more your letter grade drops by two. You also never see your grade in Canvas, unless it's mid-term or the end of the semester.","Dr. Kapadia was by no means my favorite professor. She only had 5 assignments (4 essays and attendance) and grade the essays very harshly. Everyone I asked or overheard talking in the class said they get mid C to low B on every essay even they fixed the notes on the previous essay. She will not give you any tests or exams in this class. Expect a C.","Professor Kapadia is one of my favorite professors. I highly encourage taking one of her courses. Tests are easy if you listen to lecture and take notes.","Dr. Kapadia has been one of my favorite english teachers of all time. ENG 291, now known as ENG 102 was required for my major. She gives amazing feedback and is willing to work with you to improve your writing if you're a good student. SHOW UP to class, participate in discussions, and show interest in making your writing better, and you'll do fine.","Go to class and get the book. Everything else is easy as pie. She's a bit intimidating at first but as long as you do the work she's easy to get along with. Tough grader but fair with assignments.","Professor Kapadia is awesome. She is funny, incredibly smart, and makes class as interesting as possible. She puts on a 'tough, uncaring' act on the first day, but is not at all hard to talk to-- she just demands respect, which is admirable. She really made the literature we examined interesting, I learned a lot!","One of the best Professor's I have ever had. On the first day she may come off a little not caring but she is so helpful. She gives great feed back but make sure you go to class. Everyday she dismissed class early . She has conferences with her students and they are so helpful. This is a class that you actually LEARN stuff  just put in some work.","There were only four total papers in her class, minimum room to escape one bad grade. She is a very tough grader. Some will say she's rude, I would say she's just blunt and straight forward. Attendance is part of the grade (apparently), so you don't miss class. The class before day a paper is due is optional to attend with no damage to your grade.","All the people saying Parmita is rude and doesn't care about her students are the ones that didn't care to work in her class. She's very specific with her lectures and will not ask you something that she didn't cover in class. Her lectures constantly leave me inspired and interested in the content.

Mr. Human did not respond. My grade dropped instantly from A to F. He only allows absences from deaths. He also posted the wrong time for finals causing many students to miss it.","Would not recommend. Little effort was put into the class structure, multiple weeks of having in class time to work on projects may seem great but does not further my knowledge of accounting and I could just do that on my own. ","I took Professor Human for both ACC 200 and 201 and he is genuinely a great professor. Accounting is difficult so it is a hard class, but he explains material very well and makes lectures bearable. There are only a couple homework assignments a week and he lets you use a note card on exams as well. I will always recommend him!","I had him in person and he was great. He was so easy and gave credit just for being there. I had him online and he wa horrible. If you submit an assignment even one minute late you will recieve a 0. He asks you to email him for questions yet when you email him, he either doesn't respond or tells you to look back the assignment. Would not recommed.","I was worried about this class because a lot of people fail. However, Jay has been awesome. He makes sure you understand the material and he is a super approachable nice guy. Always willing to help and an understanding grader on tests. Homework assignment once a week and occasional quizzes. Take him for class and lab!!","Very kind and like-able. If you attend class then you should have no problem.","Best professor I have ever had. Super personable and funny and made class interesting. By far, my favorite professor, he tells the best stories.","I hate accounting but he made it better. He really want s to help you do your best. Interesting stories in class.","If you follow instructions and turn everything the grading is easy. Everything is available early so you can work ahead. I had a problem with my filezila account and IT couldn't help me. I sent him a couple of screenshots and he showed me how to fix it right away. The only bad thing was too many assignments.","You can only contact via Email. No in-person meetings\/sessions. Which really sucks, because this prof has the tendency to grade weeks behind of submitted work. Little to no extra credit opportunities. This prof is also real ambiguous in regards to makeup work\/second chances at assignments. He'll take off 50% of late work within a week, that's it.","Great teacher. I dropped accounting before because of another teacher. J really cares and wants his students to do well. I wish he taught more classes. This class is so hard but he helped me pass.","He is one of the best teachers I had. He is so nice and was really helpful anytime I needed. He warned us that he was strict on late work because he wants to prepare you for the job world. The students who do bad wait until the last minute then complained that he graded hard. He expects you to follow instructions and you will get a good grade.","Takes forever to respond to emails. Sometimes he doesn't even respond at all. In AN ONLINE CLASS. Still blows my mind how that's possible. He doesn't even teach the class all he does is upload videos to watch. Blackboard grades the tests. So I'm not sure why he's considered a professor. The online video website is spotty as well.","I'd like to point out that not only are the other students reviewing here correct in his over-zealous approach to grading, the -10 and -20 points off are on a scale of 50 points per assignment. Miss a tag? Goodbye.","Avoid his section at all cost. Rarely emails back, waits weeks to grade multiple assignments. Takes points off for the most mundane things. Missing a title on your page? -10 pts. One line of code wrong? -30. Will just tell you that \"one bad grade or 0 won't hurt you\" but it will. It will hurt hard. Don't expect help, just no mercy. At all.","Terrible terrible, avoid at all cost. Grades WAY to hard especially for an intro level. it would be fine if he only took off a few points for missing minor things but he ends up taking off like 20 points. HE WILL NOT HELP YOU EVER even if you ask nicely gives terrible responses. think you get an A on something? chances are you will really get a C.","Awful. He grades way too harshly, considering this is an intro class. Always looking for mistakes, instead of looking if the assignment is fulfilled. Very redundant in lectures, and does not include all information needed for the assignments. \"Look for it yourself\". I'd avoid him at all costs.","Easy online class. He let me resubmit my web pages that didnt show up, mysteriously. Easy A","Online class. Taught nothing on own, only sent students to youtube videos to learn on own. Replied to e-mail questions very ambiguously, thus, no clear answer or solution was ever given. Despite both of these things, grades very hard (especially for it being a 100 level class)","A fun class, he makes things interesting. But is IMPOSSIBLE to get an A.

I was still able to make up my assignments. He was very caring and understanding of the technical issues I was having. Highly recommend ","Literally the worst professor ever. Do NOT take him. He does not grade. He does not teach. But still expects work to be done on time. Doesn't accept or respond to emails. No assignment has a clear due date. Wants you to call him and \"beg\" to retake tests. He has no idea how to be a professor and is being reported. Save yourself a headache.","Dr Kenney is a nice guy who seems to really care about teaching but he's not good at it. The online format is impossible to navigate and its hard to tell what you're being graded by and how. He refuses to answer emails, you have to call him to ask questions. There is a ton of reading required each week and so much writing as well","Robert Kenney assists my actual professor in my health care ethics course. The assignments are convoluted and his grading scale is too difficult considering the subject. I was able to make an A, but I had to work for it. Writing comes naturally for me and I usually excel in writing based courses, yet with him I never scored higher than a 95.","Nice professor, but gives way to much work. Very confusing with the on-line format. Would not recommend if you are a full time student. He gives as much writing work if you were in a writing class.

He's got a good sense of humor if you understand him.  Take good notes, study good and you will do fine.  He will help you whenever you need it.","Booker was not prepared to teach this class and it showed. He tended to argue frequently with students about historical facts, dates, & data & refused to accept when he was wrong. While he is very personable, nice, and accommodating, he was not prepared to teach a graduate level course.","Very interesting prof.  I loved his class.  Very entertaining, keeps students attention.  Tells you what he expects in the beginning.  It is essential that you READ THE BOOK.  If you don't, it will be difficult to do good.  Great prof all around.

This is not a class about culture, but she spent much of class time to discuss and make fun of other cultures. Repeat herself over and over again. There are essays due mostly every week. Worst experience I ever have at NKU.","A lot of homework and writing assignments. Rude to students. Repeat herself every now and then during her lecture and get mad at students easily.","Bonni is a good professor with crazy interesting stories, but is often very loud and rude to students. If you don't like being the center of attention, be wary of taking her class, because anyone can get called on at any time. The textbook (her book) is a very good read, and tests are pretty easy because the topics are very simple.","The materials are dry, really outdated. You have one Essay and one quiz which requires you to read almost every week. Class discussion can be fun but rude at the same time. The professor spent 20 minutes yelling at the class if a few students did not come to class or missed assignments. Never recommend her!","The material is very outdated, mostly not updated since 2000. Dr. Li gets distracted easily. Also, she spends a large portion of class time just to ask many personal questions and try to give comments on personal lives which is rude sometimes. Overall, worst class I ever had at NKU.","Professor Li is a wonderful Sociology professor. Her tests and quizzes are heavily lecture based but if you come to class these should be easy for you. She gives stories in between notes to allow you to write down the notes and to be able to grasp the material better. An easy class, you just need to put in effort. Would take a class w\/ her again.","Nice but she is easily distracted, hard to understand, and awful\/outdated lectures. Do not take her unless you have to. You'll thank me later for saving your sanity.","This was an online class and it was super easy. If you have to take this class, but do not want to, I would suggest taking this online version. You read a lot but the tests and quizzes are easy as can be. She is very responsive to emails.","Easy class, interesting professor. She uses her book for the class which is about emigrating from China, she uses basic sociology terms and examples. Prepare to read as if you are in elementary school, it is very simply written. Tests were super easy IF you look for the exact answer in her powerpoint notes, she words it the exact same in the notes.","This professor actually goes by Bonni Li. There are a lot more reviews for her under that name. She is an amazing professor and is absolutely hilarious.

She makes lectures fun, and she does have an accent, but she's not hard to understand AT ALL. Loved her and the class. ","This was a hybrid course.  Part online and part on campus.  She is a great professor!  Hilde knows her stuff and makes Anatomy, which is difficult, do-able.  There is a lot of information, but if you study her notes and go to class, you can get a good grade.  She is very clear on what you need to study and know for exams.  She is also very helpful.","I have her for 208 lab, she is excellent!  she explains it well and her exams are straight forward, no tricks.  If you study and know the info, you'll be fine.  Go to open lab!!!  If you don't study, you won't do well regardless of the instructor.  I have an A+, but I work hard!","HORRIBLE. You can't understand her and her classes are so boring. I've emailed her multiple times about helping me out and she never responded. I don't recommend her.","She uses PP notes and has you fill in blanks so you have to go to class to get her notes. Studied hard for 2-3 days before exams and then you take them and realize they are pretty easy (she can make them so much harder but doesn't-simple MC ?s) she gives ECr asst week before exam but only for 2.5pts, her exams (4 exams) come straight from her ppts","She is really hard to understand because she speaks so slow. She also doesn't explain things very well if you ask her a question. You have to go to all her classes and take lots of notes if you want to pass.","Had her for lecture in 208. Thought I would take her for 209 Lab. What a mistake. Very difficult! Hard to understand but ask her to make your class study guides, it helps a lot.

She is very knowledgeable about anatomy and will answer any questions you ask. She is the sweetest lady! Although, her tests are difficult, must study hard!","This professor is great. Hard material but if you study straight out of the book you should do fine. Do well on the first test, it will make the class easier. I had to take a remedial math class and got a B+ in this class. You don't have to be smart to do well, just look at the material a lot","Dr. Baldridge is a sweetheart! She ALWAYS offers to answer any questions you may have. Tests are the only grade other than a couple small extra credit assignments. They are also straight from the notes though so go to class!","She is the best anatomy professor NKU has.

I am not getting a good grade but it's all my fault. She's my favorite professor! She is so willing to help and meet with you anytime! All the test questions come from the notes. I have NEVER used the textbook. It's a really challenging class, but if you have to take it, pick her!","Hard to understand, never opened the book in class. Hated the class.

Nothing makes sense and he says that if it doesn't click then it won't ever click.. it's finals week and NOTHING has clicked..","Dennis is extremely passionate about his classes. It's hard to not appreciate the care he has for it. His material just wasn't interesting to me. Very nice guy. Has a few papers that he gives throughout the semester. As long as you show effort, you'll get a good grade. He grades based on what you put into it, not right answers necessarily. ","I love his classes! He's the good kind if crazy you want in a professor and is kind. He will be late (is always talking to students) and will run over (very passionate about phi). He will challenge you, but not out of disrespect so don't be afraid to be active in class. Be prepared to read and take pop quizzes. Exams are usually take home papers.","He's a great professor who goes above and beyond to help his students. Ever wonder why he's late? Because he talks to every student that has a question after class. Not to mention the students that pop into his office for personal advice. He does ramble, but that's part of PHI. If you want hard data spouted at you PHI is not the section to take.","He's the best philosophy professor at NKU! Love the guy!","Unclear teaching, curriculum, and grading. Learned as much in a semester of his teaching as I did in a week of other philosophy courses. If you want a real philosphical course do not take his class. He talks in circles as though he just wants to get the course over with.","I LOVE PROFESSOR MILLER! He is such a helpful professor, best class ever. It's easy, but you learn SO much!","Professor Miller is a passionate teacher. He observes the world in a unique way and challenges students to recognize the narrowness of their own views. He is always late because he helps students, even giving his own time to do philosophical counseling. Relaxed, low pressure. Must be mature to do well. Love him and have had many classes with him.","great teacher, have to read 3 books. Be in class in order to take the quizes. As long as you read and keep your journal together you will get an A. He was a little late everyday but if you forgot to read its good to skim the chapter then :) He makes you think, and opens your eyes to alot.

Late to class at least 10 minutes EVERY DAY, assignments and exams were utterly confusing and unclear, and the class was near impossible to sit through. All he did was ramble and scream...

Lectures are long and information filled but he does a good job of segmenting it to keep your attention. Some people don't like the way he goes through problems, but I like watching someone do an example instead of baby-stepping us through the. Highly recommend.","Collins is the worst professor. He writes everything in cursive so if you were born after 1998, dont take him because we were not taught cursive. He also doesnt really teach and expects you to know everything. I still have not received my final test grade and its been almost two semesters. He takes easy content and makes it IMPOSSIBLE to learn.","He is a nice person but a terrible professor. If you skip class or do not do the homework, you won't pass.","Really good at explaining things, always willing to go the pace you need to go","Terrible teacher doesnt know what hes talking about teaches things so difficult expects you to know what he does","Mr. Collins is a fantastic teacher, as a matter of fact I just registered for another one of his classes. If you honestly put forth the effort you will do great in this class. The thing that I love the most about him is that he teaches the material, tells you what homework problems to do, and then at the beginning of every class he goes over it!","I LOVE professor Collins. I think he is such a sweet guy and genuinely cares about his students' success. His lectures can sometimes get confusing, but he is happy to answer questions. Definitely show up to class though bc you'll miss a lot if you miss a class session. This class is especially easy if you've taken algebra before!","I took this class for maybe two months this semester and had to drop it. His teaching style is very confusing, he often gets lost or makes mistakes while he's trying to explain problems  to the class and if he can't keep up with them I'm not sure how we are supposed to.","I'm having him right now for MAT114. I'd say he gets you loss very easy. He just gives examples and ask the class if they have any questions. But how can anyone ask if they are loss in the first place? All homework are online. The practice problems are not graded. There're a lot of content than you think. But he is a nice old man to talk to.","He is not very helpful when it comes to answering questions. He doesn't even really teach. He just puts examples on the board and expects us to know how he got the answer. He's very rude and isn't consistent with grading. He'll take points off for one person's wrong answer but not another's. It's very annoying.","Do the homework and you'll do fine in his class. He's always willing to go over the problems from the homework the next day before you turn it in. Ask questions, don't be afraid of being judged by other students. Majority of the time, someone else wanted to ask it but was too insecure. Put forth the effort and you'll get a great return from him.","The class itself is not complicated if you have a good professor, but professor Collins is not helpful. His lectures consist of him writing examples on the board, not explaining them, and expecting you to simply understand his process.","I honestly don't think the class itself was hard I just think he could've done a better job teaching. You definitely should show up to class. He's a really nice man and he will help you if you ask but the help isn't exactly helpful...","In his class right now. You have to go to class to understand the material. He's not exactly a bad professor, but he gets distracted very easily, and can't see anybody in the back of the room. Quizzes at least once a week. Pay attention and do your homework and you should be fine.","He doesn't collect the homework, but in order to do well in the class it is really essential that you do it. He does care about his students, and is very willing to help during his office hours. He gives a lot of partial credit when grading tests and quizzes.","Professor is half blind, and is bad at responding to questions. The examples on the board are written in chicken scratch and if you want him to go over a specific part again, he probably won't. Doesn't like to help, and just assumes you know what he's talking about. I found the class extremely hard. ","If you're not good at math, I don't recommend him. Assumes you know what he is talking about at all times. All homeworks from the section can be turned in anytime before the test, but don't let yourself fall behind because it's easy to just push all the homeworks aside until the last minute. Does not curve tests or give extra credit whatsoever. ","Collins is a good teacher! Be sure to pay attention during class and do the homework and you will be good! You go over homework each class and get a quiz every friday! Your homework  has everything the quizzes are over and if you don't understand you can ask during class and he will love to help! Gives 3 extra quizzes to replace lowest quiz grades!","This class is NOT easy and he is NOT a easy grader. I attended every class and barely passed.. literally by a couple points.

Tests were very similar to study guides.","She's really nice but at times, tends to treat students like they are in middle school or high school. Homework is given but no specific due date, and is not necessarily graded. It's just for practice and studying for tests. Attendance isn't mandatory but I don't recommend skipping because she does a new chapter everyday.","IF YOU STRUGGLE IN MATH TAKE HER CLASS.

Take his class in person! Online version is excessive busy work. In person class includes a few quizzes, an open-response, opinion-based midterm and final, and one debate group project that was simple.","He focused mainly on African bioethics when it was supposed to be a general class. Not easy to access outside of class, isn't even the one to grade the work. His assistant gives low grades with no feedback. He even makes you buy his dumb African bioethics book. Please do not take this guy, he is horrible, this should have been a fun class.","Dr. Yaw is a nice professor with quick response times. That being said his bioethics course focused almost solely on African bioethics even though the course was health care bioethics. 1 out of 4 exams is multiple choice the rest are written 3-4 page papers. If you have difficulty writing papers do NOT take his class.","Never knows how long his class is supposed to last, gives a syllabus for an 8 week course, divides work as such, turns out its a 16 week course everyone's confused","It was a pleasure to have Dr. Yaw. His lectures were very informative and engaging. You definitely want to read the material before you come to class. One thing I really liked is that he would tell us what the extended response question(s) were going to be on a test; rather than testing our memorization, he wanted to see us engage in critical thought with the material. Overall, I would recommend Dr. Yaw as a professor - you do have to put in time and effort, but I think the experience is rewarding.","I have no idea why anyone would give him a low score.  I made nothing below a 93 in the class.  He doesn't overload you with work and I took the 8 week version of the class.  Anyone that complains about him is just a whiner.","Hardest teacher possible. Covers almost no material, doesn't give you feed back on why answers are incorrect. Grades very subjectively. WE ARE NOT PHI MAJORS!","I can't speak for Dr. Yaw's in-person classes, but do not take him online unless you enjoy independent study. Minimal interaction - no recorded lectures or anything. Materials were long reading assignments and Powerpoint slides with a few YouTube videos. Had to contact several times for clarification on assignment instructions. Don't recommend.","some exams are too hard, can't even find between lines, and some are the exactly from the study guide. NOT helpful at all","The first week I was worried, he is from Ghana and has an accent and I was afraid he would be hard to understand, I was wrong. Very funny, very easy, gives study guides with answers before all tests. Very understanding about late work. I wish he taught more classes I needed.","All of the test question comes from text book. Answers are easy to find, and tests are open notes.This class feels like an debate\/opinion based class. I recommend him","I can't objectively say everything I want to say in this limited space. Shortened version: most of the class went to the chairs of CIT and PHI and voiced concerns about how the class was being taught. Class time was spent poorly and it was basically not worth going to the lectures b\/c he didn't go over course material.  Read the book, take the test","Great teacher","He gives quizzes every week. You have to get the answers right from the book. He isn't very helpful in class but he does give extra credit. He's not the best teacher in the world, but I could tolerate him. I'd take the class, but be warned that sometimes you'll want to walk right out the door!","One of the best teachers I have had so far.  Fair in grading.

My freshman experience was stressful and negative, however, taking her again as a sophomore, she is a lot more relaxed. Willing to work with students to find their passion in research projects.","I will never take this professor again. In assignments, she would leave out required criteria, so when she finally graded them, no one would include the requirement (because she didn't tell anyone about it & it wasn't in the syllabus) and everyone would that deducted. This happened multiple times throughout the course -everyone's grades suffered.","we have 7 different papers due still and there is only a week and half left of the semester!! unorganized! I have only had 2 grades returned at this point. I didn't know professors were allowed to conduct the online part of a hybrid class through Facebook, but she did.  I have never had this much homework in any class, and I'm studying engineering!","She is a nice person, but she is a little disorganized. Communicates mostly by Facebook. The class was interesting.","She was a nice lady but an awful professor. Her grading was nonsensical and if you dared to disagree with her she would argue with you until you gave up. If she disliked your ideas she would trash them and then tell you what to do. She was unprofessional and wouldn''t stop until you saw the light meaning her way.","Sweet in person, not as a professor. It was her opinion or no opinion, and if you didn't agree she talked until you gave in. If you didn't see it her way, you saw it wrong. Classwork not difficult, but project is completely up in the air. Good luck.","Really nice as a person, but not so much as a professor. Very vague in her instructions. Trashed your proposal if she didn't personally like your topic. Very dominating in discussion. Essentially, it was her opinion or none. However, I'd still take her class again if I absolutely had to. Not a horrible professor, but not great, either.","Ali is a good person, but some of her teaching methods are questionable. I didn't always know what she wanted in a speech and the grades were never posted on BB. I'm not saying don't take her, but weigh your options.","Ali is a very nice and relatable person overall, but my experience with her this semester was less than pleasant. She was very unorganized, losing several students' papers and missing important deadlines, and she wasn't particularly understanding with anyone (although she expected us to be with her.) Generally, she's nice, but I wouldn't recommend.","Ali's class was interesting. She's quite the character. Though I initially did not enjoy her class, I warmed up to her over the semester. Her humor can sometimes be a little harsh but it was an easy A, especially for an Honors course.","Pretty good professor. Easily gets sidetracked, but really knows what she is talking about. A lot of reading and writing involved, but grades pretty easily.","Very nice and approachable. Seemed to have favorites, but I believe all grading was fair. I liked her enough to sign up for another one of her class","Ali's a nice, relatable and approachable professor. Her syllabus is clearly outlined and everything you do is in it, including how the assignments will be graded. Sometimes her grading is a little weird (gave a low grade but didn't comment why) but if you ask her about it she's more than willing to explain. Overall, great!","Not difficult if you just talk to her after a speech about the outline and what she wants followed. Don't be afraid to talk to her. Great professor to get to know.","An obvious **** teacher towards girls. If you're a guy you're screwed.","one of the worst classes i've ever taken. hated, hated, hated it. chooses favorites. at the beginning of the semester she said she wouldn't let anyone rag on things that other people liked, but i never ever ever felt comfortable sharing anything because i knew i'd be heckled for it. AWFUL.","Ali is a great speech teacher.  She made class very fun and I really enjoyed going to class everyday.  I never missed her class.

The lectures at the beggining of his labs are long and very boring.","Dr. Blewett is the best.  He lets students email him, call him (at his home), or will come in to help students.

Usually would let out class early. 3 papers and 2 exams.","She's an absolutely awful grader.  For example, I had 5 typos and got a 75%.... You would think that she would at least take off 2 points out of 20.  Another example, my peer put in an extra insightful quote but it wasn't from the reading.  She gave him a 75%.  Second time going to her class (I have her every Wedn. night) and I'm already hating it.","Her class was easy. Most of the work was in-class two page essays, based on the textbook. The essays are not bad, and she did not necessarily take points off for late in-class work.  She expects the papers for outside of class to be handed in on time. The in-class work can be done ahead of time, and she also allows a work at your own pace classroom","SHe is so sweet. You HAVE to show up for class. If you read the short stories then you will pass most def. She has three papers that are not too hard. Just show up and do the work and you should get a good grade. TAKE HER !","Dr. Roemer is a very nice woman, who does have some quirks, but overall I enjoyed her class. Readings were interesting, and the term paper due at the end of the semester isn't as daunting as it seems once you get into it.  She only covered what is in the syllabus each day, so we routinely got out of class early. Would recommend.","Dr. Roemer is very sweet and as long as you attend class and read the short stories before class you'll do fine.  She has three papers due throughout the semester which I feel are too long for what the subject is but it's not a very big deal.  This class is an easy A and I recommend Roemer!","Mrs. Roemer is a sweet older lady who takes attendance grades. The papers are stretched but fairly easy. Very good grading. Short papers to write everyday but you can leave after you write them or do them before class and take attendance and leave. 3 big papers, 2 are 4-6 pages and the last one is 8pgs. I would highly recommend Roemer!!","I would for sure recommend her! She is so easy. Just come for most classes, she cancels a decent amount, and read before. EASY A! She shows alot of videos and there is only 3 papers and couple of basic quizzes over readings. TAKE HER AND GET AN EASY GRADE!","you dont use the textbook- all the articles you have to write about can be found online. she is strange- and cancels class a lot. just follow the directions for the things you have to write and you'll get an A. very nice woman. i recommend this class for an easy A.","Assigns readings but winds up reading them aloud in class and offers no real insight to what's been discussed. Papers are terrible if only because they're so... uninspired. They have no real direction and you wind up really stretching what little info you have to get 4 pages. A sweet lady but the class feels like you're in middle school again.","A great class. You might not learn a ton, but it's still an interesting class. Just show up, read the short stories and you'll get an A. She is a great person.","I cannot believe that she has a bad rating! This is not exactly a fun class but it is not hard at all. As long as you show up, read and put at least some effort into this class you will be more than fine. I wouldn't have taken this class with anyone else!","Dr. Roemer was a very nice lady. She can be a little weird but this class is easy. It is very boring but she grades very easy. You only have to read short stories and take quizes on them. Just read the stories, they are usually only a few pages and the quizes are an easy pass. The papers are easy, just write what the story says and you'll get an A.","this woman is nice and professional but there is somethine about the way she talks that can drive a person nuts, always taking breaths in in the middle of EVERy sentince and always monotonus. she also stares stright ahead and her eyes seem so dialated like she is on the verge of not even being mentally present. smart lady though,cant take that away","Awesome teacher. If you listen in class and understand what she expects from you, you'll get A's everytime. She is a really nice lady and doesn't demand too much from you.","Dr Roemer would assign reading, then read aloud the same assignment the next day in class with elementary insight into the text.

I learned more in this class than in the previous two OOP classes combined. Be warned: He admitted to \"leaving things out\" of homework assignments just to get you to ask him questions.

She didn't go by the book. Buying the book was a waste of my money. Only used the online aspect MyPsychLab for extra credit to pass the class.

Can't really afford to miss any classes, he moves at a quick pace.  Tests are all define and short answer coming straight from your notes.","Classes tend to drag on, as it is all lecture. He takes everything straight from the lectures. I haven't cracked the book yet. The tests suck. They are all definitions and explanations, and I never had time to finish them. I wouldn't recommend him.","Avoid this class if possible. He grades very hard. You need to take perfect notes with examples, completely memorize ur notes, and do not forget anything for the test. Tests: 20 essay questions. Grades hard. This class is harder than my 400 level classes! DO NOT TAKE!!!","The class was ECO and Organized Crime.  This was a very fun class.  But as with all of his classes you have to go to class and take notes to get a good grade.  I would recommend him as a professor; he is not the typical dry Economics professor.","Tough class. You need to have picture perfect notes. And on the test you have to memorize your notes forwards and backwards. Other words try and avoid this class.","He's a fun professor and someone who seems like would make a great fan. He has a ton of cool stories from growing up in NYC. As for teaching, he quizzes exclusively from his notes, so you don't even need the textbook. Just make sure your notes are thorough and be prepared to remember everything on the quizzes.","His lectures can be interesting.  His test are right from the notes.  If you go to class and take notes you will get an A in the class.","He really knew the material, but sometimes he gets carried away with explainations.  All of the exams are short answer (he wants defos of, like, everything).","His test are impossible and get ready to write down everything he says otherwise you fail. Lets face it Econ sucks anyways good luck!","Great teacher! Loved his class.  You take a lot of notes, and the tests are short answer, but show up for the review and pay attention and you'll do fine.","Very interesting professor, puts Economics into perspective for the common man. His tests are short answer and essay...a bit hard but nothing that you wouldn't expect out of a college course.","I liked him a lot, you do have to take a lot of notes (by choice) and if you miss a class you are not going to know what happened.  You don't use the book at all.  Although you take a lot of notes and the tests are not a walk in the park I would recommend to anyone.","Good Professor. But his tests are impossibly hard. Be prepared to have mass headaches.","A great teacher of economics. He did a good job of explaining things and is very helpful if u do have questions for him. However, u must show up for class and take notes bc he doesn't use the book. Pay very close attention bc the notes he puts on the board are very unclear and hard to follow. beware of his tests, he is an extremely hard grader!!!","He is a great professor.  He does not use the book, because he has a lot of knowledge in the field.  He teaches in a way that makes it easy to understand by using pop culture to explain Economics.  I would take another class that he teaches.","Good professor. Must attend and take good notes. If you do that no problem getting an A. Text books for him are useless,don't waste your money.","This prof is hard.  He expects students to attend class, pay attention, and take notes.  His exams that require serious studying before hand.  He must think he's teaching a college-level course or something.","I think he's a great teacher. His test are pretty straight forward but its a very good idea to take alot of notes. It does suck that test are the only way to get grades. And I think he kinda sounds like Chistopher Walken. I swear.","great prof.  this is college kids, you have to come to class and LISTEN, and study to do well.  his exams are hard, but it is possible to get an A. he is a much better econ prof. then many others, he has real life mixed in which keeps it interesting."],"Department":"Economics & Finance","Rating Value":3.4,"Rating Count":40,"Would Take Again":0.0,"Difficulty":3.8,"University":"Northern Kentucky University","Link":"https:\/\/www.ratemyprofessors.com\/professor\/136849","Score":0.5686829268}

He talks down to students and teaches as though everyone has the mind set of a high schooler. \"Do you understand what I am saying?' was a common question he would ask the class. He preaches about diversity but I am confident that he does not believe in it.","I've had several classes with Dr. Turner because I liked him so much. He's tough on students but in all honesty if you do the reading and work required it's not that hard. He makes sure students understand the material before testing them on it.

Considers things during discussion, and is critical of opinions (this is a good thing.  It means he can think).  VERY APPRECIATIVE OF HARD WORK.","This class was horrible!

He is absolutely horrible!","At first I though he was going to be a good teacher, he started off the first class saying how he understands the hard life of a student...he then proceded to dump loads of work ontop of us giving us a very limited amount of days to fulfill the wishes. He can be intimidating, and class drones on. His grading is aweful, he provides no rubric at all","At first, it took me a little while to get used to him because he can be opinionated. However, over all, he's a good guy & a great teacher. You do 5 papers & one of those is a group project. You have to earn your grade in here, here he does not tolerate slackers. Come to class and put in the effort and you will do well in this class.","Asks students questions, doesn't listen to the students answers.  Loves nit-picking and asking questions that lead into boring stories he likes to tell.  Awful class.  Were this class not required, I would drop it like it's hot.","Very good professor. He uses his experiences in life with the books you read. You read 4 books and write several (I think 5) papers. Unless you are motivated to read the books and write the papers you arent going to pass. Very helpful if you ask. Very specific. Be sure to ask for help if you need it.

Will not help you after class and will not help you at all if your a guy. He is all about helping the ladies. Worked on a project with a girl, suppost to get the same grade but somehow she did better. Won the debate acording to class but still got a lower grade than the girl i debated.

Do not take if you are not prepared for the work load. Nice teacher if you try. Otherwise forget it.","I liked her, but not as a teacher.  She was helpful, but the class was very difficult for a 100 level class.  You HAVE to attend class.  HAVE TO.  It will end up reall affecting your grade if you do not.","Over all, I thought she was a great teacher. I did not like how she wouldn't let us use Google or other non-NKU search engines for our last 2 individual speeches (but let us do so for the first), but I really liked her; she was really nice, helpful, and always saw the best in us. I significantly improved my public speaking skills thanks to her.","This teacher is very hard. I took this class because I had to. I was taking chemistry at the same time as this class and found myself doing more work for a 100 level speech class then my 200 level chemistry class. I would recommend taking another teacher.","Great teacher! very helpful lots of notes but all our posted online. Work can be hard but if you attend the class you will do fine!","Mrs. Ragsdale is phenomenal.

I found myself working very hard to receive a good grade in the class. However, her class is very useful and rewarding.","Horrible!!

Held class during finals week (new material) and gave half new half cumulative final 2 days later.  3 tests, HW and quiz for almost ever chapter.  Can be a little blunt\/harsh sometimes.","For those who actually care about his or her education Dr. W is a great professor.  Many students give her poor reviews, but those students probably didn't put in much effort.  The only thing I wish she would improve, would be the amount of time it takes her to return grades.  If you want a challenging yet rewarding class take her!!","Awful professor!Does not keep up with grades which is ridiculous since all she has to grade are quizzes and test. Her \"teaching\" style is reading off powerpoint. Avoid her if possible.","She was a terrible professor for ACC 300. All she did was read from her PowerPoints, not keep up with Blackboard or grade our projects, yelled at a student for not laying his project down \"nicely\", made people come sit in the front of the class, and the night before final grades were due, she emailed us asking to re-submit a project due weeks ago.","Dr. W was very helpful in explaining all of the material. The class does have some tough concepts to understand but she does an amazing job of translating the work into something you can understand. Do the homework, study for quizzes, if you have questions ask them and you will be fine. By far one of the best professors I have had at NKU.","Shes okay, she rushes through some material so she can cover all the topics. Theres online HW about once a week but its just to reinforce what you went over in class.","If you don't mess around in class and follow along with the logic she uses, she is very helpful. She does not like people who mess around and is not afraid to call people out sometimes. Do ALL the homework and don't be afraid to ASK QUESTIONS. She is more than willing to help, even on exams.","She is very helpful and wants you to understand. The subject matter is challenging and not very exciting but she does the best she can with it. And if you want to learn, she will make sure you do that.","Aggrivating to say the least. Runs through powerpoint slides so fast you cant keep up. Sometimes will even give quizzes on chapters we havent completely finished.Tests are very difficult. Shes a nice lady but doesnt look comfortable in class, and she's very hard to understand. Did curve final but still very hard class that i barely got through.","She is a great professor! Her class is very challenging, but she teaches in a way that is very detailed and clear. If you apply yourself, go to class and do the homework you will do well. She is a no nonsense lady, she expects you to take he class seriously and be respectful. I learned a great deal from her class and respect her as a professor!","She is tough but if you don't mess around in class (texting, other HW, etc.) she will like you and you're more than likely to get a good grade. Do not miss class or you will  not be able to catch up. Lots of homework but really helps with midterm and final.","Very helpful acct teacher I have ever had.  She makes her notes very clear to follow.  I like her teaching method.  Just need to be very attentive in the class, follow her notes\/homework instructions, and you should be fine.  Fair teacher.  Will recommend.","Worst teacher I've ever had at NKU. She runs through her powerpoints and doesn't actually teach anything! She will go over one or two problems with you, but she wants to finish her powerpoints rather actually teach you the material.

My biggest complaint would have to be the fact that when I went to her office for help after the first exam, she laughed at me and said I must have not studied ... not the case.

I got the grade that I did by working my butt off.","Ragsdale is a really great guy. He's very nice and willing to help if confused.

He goes over power-points EVERY class. The power-points are on blackboard as well which makes it easy to want to skip and teach yourself... DON'T!

{"Name":"Elizabeth McMillian Mcartney ","Comment":["This Professor is the worst teacher\/professor I've ever had and will have. If you are not the best in math never take a class with her and if you know you have her drop or change the class immediately. She's horrible at teaching, when you have a question she never answers it clearly, gives grades for not important things and grades tests very hard","Two assignments due a day. Very confusing. Textbook is online, wouldn't recommend buying it, I would just buy the Pearson code. There are like 5-6 tests, each question is worth 5 points, so you get credit for trying. Also you can do corrections on every test. She is very strict on attendance, you get points taken off, I skipped two classes.","This class is absolutely terrible, this was a remedial class for me.. I completely changed my major so that I didn't have to take her! I would recommend any other professor, just do NOT take her!","She is a horrible professor. She doesn't help or accommodate to her students needs. If you have disability services she doesn't care and does what she think she should for you. She stares and writes on the board the whole time and basically talks to herself and is confusing. I HIGHLY reccomend getting another professor.  ","This woman should not be a teacher. I literally couldn't go to class because I knew that I would either be sleeping or trying to pay attention. Her voice is mono tone and she acts as if she doesn't want to be there. She doesn't teach, she's totally dependent on the online material. I should have said this was an online class. I DROPPED!","Worst teacher I've ever had!! Only reason I new anything was from remembering everything from high school.","By far the worse teacher I have ever had! I am farther behind in math now then I was at the beginning of the semester. She rarely explains things, and when she does, she makes no sense of it and gets way off topic. She should not be teaching! I showed up every day and still dont understand what she is saying.","She isn't very helpful and is really confusing. Mymathlab teaches you better than she does.","she teaches way too fast, i couldnt even take notes before the problem would be erased on the board. She is helpful if you dont understand.","I'm no better with math having taken this course, the professor was unhelpful, teaches new material an hour before you take exams, doesn't  explain things well, she even told me that it was no big deal if I didn't pass it because then I would understand it even more the second time around. Don't take her if you value your sanity.","the class was easy because I already knew Algebra. But if I didn't know Algebra, I'm sure I will have failed in her class. Good things: she is innocent. Bad things: boring class, take the grade out with any sill mistake, I'm a great student in Algebra and I didn't get A because she puts X for whole answer if there is a very very small mistake.","Easy class anyways, but even though shes a very nice person she is not very good at explaining math. I never went to class, the online textbook explained things much better than her.","Stupid class, don't attend just do the work online. (Pace Program) She's mean and doesn't help you when you're behind. Although if you do bad on a test or quiz she will go over it with you and change your grade to something higher. Don't take her.","This class was probably the worst experience of my first semester in college. Don't get me wrong, she's a very nice person but her teaching methods weren't the best. She'd lecture non-stop for 2 hours straight. She'd get mad if you had to leave her class even the least bit early. I just wouldn't recommend this class at all","She is a pretty good teacher. She does teacher rather fast sometimes and it does get a bit confusing. For the most part if you attend class regularly and use the resources you will pass.","Very hard, not helpful can be mean. Don't know what she is teaching and give homework everyday","very unhelpful, didn't seem to care about students grasping the material and would just move right along. It's almost as if she got pleasure from watching the students struggle(with a smerk on her face) wish I would have known about Rate my professor before I took the class! Eatton is a huge help!!!","Very poor ability to connect with those behind.","This class is the worst and sucks so much I want to strangle myself and her.

Nice person outside of class, but should not be teaching!  Makes you do her research as well","The course is extremely hard.  Instead of testing general concepts, tests were over minor details.

You have to be able to sort thru everything to figure out what you really need to know.  It was frustrating.","A good likeable person but not the greatest teacher.

She was a fun teacher to listen to but her tests were very hard and I feel that she thought of herself a lot higher than her students and she never would help us out by letting us know what would be on her tricky tests.","The notes she has is all on powerpoint which makes it easy to follow but she goes through them way too fast, and forget trying to write it all down. You are better off memorizing the entire book. Test were way too difficult, especially for an intro class! Avoid taking her class or else you will be taking this class over again like me!","Avoid!
